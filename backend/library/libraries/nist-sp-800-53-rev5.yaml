        1. [Selection (one or more): Organization-level; Mission/business process-level;

        (a) Addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management commitment,
        coordination among organizational entities, and compliance; and

        (b) Is consistent with applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations,

        organization-defined events]; and

        2. Procedures [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] and following [Assignment:
        organization-defined events].'
      annotation: Access control policy and procedures address the controls in the
        AC family that are implemented within systems and organizations. The risk
        management strategy is an important factor in establishing such policies and
        procedures. Policies and procedures contribute to security and privacy assurance.
        Therefore, it is important that security and privacy programs collaborate
        on the development of access control policy and procedures. Security and privacy
        program policies and procedures at the organization level are preferable,
        in general, and may obviate the need for mission- or system-specific policies
        and procedures. The policy can be included as part of the general security
        and privacy policy or be represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex
        nature of organizations. Procedures can be established for security and privacy
        programs, for mission or business processes, and for systems, if needed. Procedures
        describe how the policies or controls are implemented and can be directed
        at the individual or role that is the object of the procedure. Procedures
        can be documented in system security and privacy plans or in one or more separate
        documents. Events that may precipitate an update to access control policy
        and procedures include assessment or audit findings, security incidents or
        breaches, or changes in laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies,
        standards, and guidelines. Simply restating controls does not constitute an
        organizational policy or procedure.

        l. Align account management processes with personnel termination and transfer
        processes.'
      annotation: 'Examples of system account types include individual, shared, group,
        system, guest, anonymous, emergency, developer, temporary, and service. Identification
        of authorized system users and the specification of access privileges reflect
        the requirements in other controls in the security plan. Users requiring administrative
        privileges on system accounts receive additional scrutiny by organizational
        personnel responsible for approving such accounts and privileged access, including
        system owner, mission or business owner, senior agency information security
        officer, or senior agency official for privacy. Types of accounts that organizations
        may wish to prohibit due to increased risk include shared, group, emergency,
        anonymous, temporary, and guest accounts.

        Where access involves personally identifiable information, security programs
        collaborate with the senior agency official for privacy to establish the specific
        conditions for group and role membership; specify authorized users, group
        and role membership, and access authorizations for each account; and create,
        adjust, or remove system accounts in accordance with organizational policies.
        Policies can include such information as account expiration dates or other
        factors that trigger the disabling of accounts. Organizations may choose to
        define access privileges or other attributes by account, type of account,
        or a combination of the two. Examples of other attributes required for authorizing
        access include restrictions on time of day, day of week, and point of origin.
        In defining other system account attributes, organizations consider system-related
        requirements and mission/business requirements. Failure to consider these
        factors could affect system availability.

        Temporary and emergency accounts are intended for short-term use. Organizations
        establish temporary accounts as part of normal account activation procedures
        when there is a need for short-term accounts without the demand for immediacy
        in account activation. Organizations establish emergency accounts in response
        to crisis situations and with the need for rapid account activation. Therefore,
        emergency account activation may bypass normal account authorization processes.
        Emergency and temporary accounts are not to be confused with infrequently
        used accounts, including local logon accounts used for special tasks or when
        network resources are unavailable (may also be known as accounts of last resort).
        Such accounts remain available and are not subject to automatic disabling
        or removal dates. Conditions for disabling or deactivating accounts include
        when shared/group, emergency, or temporary accounts are no longer required
        and when individuals are transferred or terminated. Changing shared/group
        authenticators when members leave the group is intended to ensure that former
        group members do not retain access to the shared or group account. Some types
        of system accounts may require specialized training.'

      annotation: Management of temporary and emergency accounts includes the removal
        or disabling of such accounts automatically after a predefined time period
        rather than at the convenience of the system administrator. Automatic removal
        or disabling of accounts provides a more consistent implementation.

      name: Account Management | Dynamic Privilege Management
      description: 'Implement [Assignment: organization-defined dynamic privilege
        management capabilities].'
      annotation: In contrast to access control approaches that employ static accounts
        and predefined user privileges, dynamic access control approaches rely on
        runtime access control decisions facilitated by dynamic privilege management,
        such as attribute-based access control. While user identities remain relatively
        constant over time, user privileges typically change more frequently based
        on ongoing mission or business requirements and the operational needs of organizations.
        An example of dynamic privilege management is the immediate revocation of
        privileges from users as opposed to requiring that users terminate and restart
        their sessions to reflect changes in privileges. Dynamic privilege management
        can also include mechanisms that change user privileges based on dynamic rules
        as opposed to editing specific user profiles. Examples include automatic adjustments
        of user privileges if they are operating out of their normal work times, if
        their job function or assignment changes, or if systems are under duress or
        in emergency situations. Dynamic privilege management includes the effects
        of privilege changes, for example, when there are changes to encryption keys
        used for communications.

      annotation: Privileged roles are organization-defined roles assigned to individuals
        that allow those individuals to perform certain security-relevant functions
        that ordinary users are not authorized to perform. Privileged roles include
        key management, account management, database administration, system and network
        administration, and web administration. A role-based access scheme organizes
        permitted system access and privileges into roles. In contrast, an attribute-based
        access scheme specifies allowed system access and privileges based on attributes.

      annotation: Approaches for dynamically creating, activating, managing, and deactivating
        system accounts rely on automatically provisioning the accounts at runtime
        for entities that were previously unknown. Organizations plan for the dynamic
        management, creation, activation, and deactivation of system accounts by establishing
        trust relationships, business rules, and mechanisms with appropriate authorities
        to validate related authorizations and privileges.

        monitoring. Account monitoring includes alerts generated if the account is
        used in violation of organizational parameters. Organizations can describe

        such as by restricting usage to certain days of the week, time of day, or
        specific durations of time.

      annotation: Atypical usage includes accessing systems at certain times of the

        of individuals. Monitoring for atypical usage may reveal rogue behavior by
        individuals or an attack in progress. Account monitoring may inadvertently
        create privacy risks since data collected to identify atypical usage may reveal
        previously unknown information about the behavior of individuals. Organizations
        assess and document privacy risks from monitoring accounts for atypical usage
        in their privacy impact assessment and make determinations that are in alignment
        with their privacy program plan.

        entities or objects (i.e., devices, files, records, domains) in organizational
        systems. In addition to enforcing authorized access at the system level and

        of mission and business functions, access enforcement mechanisms can also
        be employed at the application and service level to provide increased information
        security and privacy. In contrast to logical access controls that are implemented
        within the system, physical access controls are addressed by the controls
        in the Physical and Environmental Protection (PE) family.

        with information obtained from objects for which they have already been granted
        access. This prevents the subjects from passing the information to unauthorized
        subjects and objects. Mandatory access control policies constrain actions
        that subjects can take with respect to the propagation of access control privileges;
        that is, a subject with a privilege cannot pass that privilege to other subjects.
        The policy is uniformly enforced over all subjects and objects to which the
        system has control. Otherwise, the access control policy can be circumvented.
        This enforcement is provided by an implementation that meets the reference
        monitor concept as described in AC-25. The policy is bounded by the system
        (i.e., once the information is passed outside of the control of the system,
        additional means may be required to ensure that the constraints on the information
        remain in effect).

        The trusted subjects described above are granted privileges consistent with
        the concept of least privilege (see AC-6). Trusted subjects are only given
        the minimum privileges necessary for satisfying organizational mission/business
        needs relative to the above policy. The control is most applicable when there
        is a mandate that establishes a policy regarding access to controlled unclassified
        information or classified information and some users of the system are not
        authorized access to all such information resident in the system. Mandatory
        access control can operate in conjunction with discretionary access control
        as described in AC-3(4). A subject constrained in its operation by mandatory
        access control policies can still operate under the less rigorous constraints
        of AC-3(4), but mandatory access control policies take precedence over the
        less rigorous constraints of AC-3(4). For example, while a mandatory access
        control policy imposes a constraint that prevents a subject from passing information
        to another subject operating at a different impact or classification level,
        AC-3(4) permits the subject to pass the information to any other subject with
        the same impact or classification level as the subject. Examples of mandatory
        access control policies include the Bell-LaPadula policy to protect confidentiality
        of information and the Biba policy to protect the integrity of information.'

        \ the policy, and where the policy specifies that a subject that has been\

        \ to be associated with newly created or revised objects; or\n(e) Change the\
        \ rules governing access control."
      annotation: When discretionary access control policies are implemented, subjects
        are not constrained with regard to what actions they can take with information
        for which they have already been granted access. Thus, subjects that have
        been granted access to information are not prevented from passing the information
        to other subjects or objects (i.e., subjects have the discretion to pass).
        Discretionary access control can operate in conjunction with mandatory access
        control as described in AC-3(3) and AC-3(15). A subject that is constrained
        in its operation by mandatory access control policies can still operate under
        the less rigorous constraints of discretionary access control. Therefore,
        while AC-3(3) imposes constraints that prevent a subject from passing information
        to another subject operating at a different impact or classification level,
        AC-3(4) permits the subject to pass the information to any subject at the
        same impact or classification level. The policy is bounded by the system.
        Once the information is passed outside of system control, additional means
        may be required to ensure that the constraints remain in effect. While traditional
        definitions of discretionary access control require identity-based access
        control, that limitation is not required for this particular use of discretionary
        access control.

        and objects and control access based upon [Assignment: organization-defined
        roles and users authorized to assume such roles].'
      annotation: Role-based access control (RBAC) is an access control policy that
        enforces access to objects and system functions based on the defined role
        (i.e., job function) of the subject. Organizations can create specific roles
        based on job functions and the authorizations (i.e., privileges) to perform
        needed operations on the systems associated with the organization-defined
        roles. When users are assigned to specific roles, they inherit the authorizations
        or privileges defined for those roles. RBAC simplifies privilege administration
        for organizations because privileges are not assigned directly to every user
        (which can be a large number of individuals) but are instead acquired through
        role assignments. RBAC can also increase privacy and security risk if individuals
        assigned to a role are given access to information beyond what they need to
        support organizational missions or business functions. RBAC can be implemented
        as a mandatory or discretionary form of access control. For organizations
        implementing RBAC with mandatory access controls, the requirements in AC-3(3)
        define the scope of the subjects and objects covered by the policy.

        time the object is opened or the next time the subject attempts to access
        the object. Revocation based on changes to security labels may take effect
        immediately. Organizations provide alternative approaches on how to make revocations
        immediate if systems cannot provide such capability and immediate revocation
        is necessary.

      annotation: Attribute-based access control is an access control policy that
        restricts system access to authorized users based on specified organizational
        attributes (e.g., job function, identity), action attributes (e.g., read,
        write, delete), environmental attributes (e.g., time of day, location), and
        resource attributes (e.g., classification of a document). Organizations can
        create rules based on attributes and the authorizations (i.e., privileges)
        to perform needed operations on the systems associated with organization-defined
        attributes and rules. When users are assigned to attributes defined in attribute-based
        access control policies or rules, they can be provisioned to a system with
        the appropriate privileges or dynamically granted access to a protected resource.
        Attribute-based access control can be implemented as either a mandatory or
        discretionary form of access control. When implemented with mandatory access
        controls, the requirements in AC-3(3) define the scope of the subjects and

      annotation: Individual access affords individuals the ability to review personally
        identifiable information about them held within organizational records, regardless
        of format. Access helps individuals to develop an understanding about how
        their personally identifiable information is being processed. It can also
        help individuals ensure that their data is accurate. Access mechanisms can
        include request forms and application interfaces. For federal agencies, PRIVACT
        processes can be located in systems of record notices and on agency websites.
        Access to certain types of records may not be appropriate (e.g., for federal
        agencies, law enforcement records within a system of records may be exempt
        from disclosure under the PRIVACT) or may require certain levels of authentication
        assurance. Organizational personnel consult with the senior agency official
        for privacy and legal counsel to determine appropriate mechanisms and access
        rights or limitations.

      annotation: 'Information flow control regulates where information can travel
        within a system and between systems (in contrast to who is allowed to access
        the information) and without regard to subsequent accesses to that information.
        Flow control restrictions include blocking external traffic that claims to
        be from within the organization, keeping export-controlled information from
        being transmitted in the clear to the Internet, restricting web requests that
        are not from the internal web proxy server, and limiting information transfers
        between organizations based on data structures and content. Transferring information
        between organizations may require an agreement specifying how the information
        flow is enforced (see CA-3). Transferring information between systems in different
        security or privacy domains with different security or privacy policies introduces
        the risk that such transfers violate one or more domain security or privacy
        policies. In such situations, information owners/stewards provide guidance
        at designated policy enforcement points between connected systems. Organizations
        consider mandating specific architectural solutions to enforce specific security
        and privacy policies. Enforcement includes prohibiting information transfers
        between connected systems (i.e., allowing access only), verifying write permissions
        before accepting information from another security or privacy domain or connected
        system, employing hardware mechanisms to enforce one-way information flows,
        and implementing trustworthy regrading mechanisms to reassign security or
        privacy attributes and labels.

        Organizations commonly employ information flow control policies and enforcement
        mechanisms to control the flow of information between designated sources and
        destinations within systems and between connected systems. Flow control is
        based on the characteristics of the information and/or the information path.
        Enforcement occurs, for example, in boundary protection devices that employ
        rule sets or establish configuration settings that restrict system services,
        provide a packet-filtering capability based on header information, or provide
        a message-filtering capability based on message content. Organizations also
        consider the trustworthiness of filtering and/or inspection mechanisms (i.e.,
        hardware, firmware, and software components) that are critical to information
        flow enforcement. Control enhancements 3 through 32 primarily address cross-domain
        solution needs that focus on more advanced filtering techniques, in-depth
        analysis, and stronger flow enforcement mechanisms implemented in cross-domain
        products, such as high-assurance guards. Such capabilities are generally not
        available in commercial off-the-shelf products. Information flow enforcement
        also applies to control plane traffic (e.g., routing and DNS).'

      annotation: Information flow enforcement mechanisms compare security and privacy
        attributes associated with information (i.e., data content and structure)
        and source and destination objects and respond appropriately when the enforcement
        mechanisms encounter information flows not explicitly allowed by information
        flow policies. For example, an information object labeled Secret would be
        allowed to flow to a destination object labeled Secret, but an information
        object labeled Top Secret would not be allowed to flow to a destination object
        labeled Secret. A dataset of personally identifiable information may be tagged
        with restrictions against combining with other types of datasets and, thus,
        would not be allowed to flow to the restricted dataset. Security and privacy
        attributes can also include source and destination addresses employed in traffic
        filter firewalls. Flow enforcement using explicit security or privacy attributes
        can be used, for example, to control the release of certain types of information.

        are assigned to domains, information is identified by types, and information
        flows are controlled based on allowed information accesses (i.e., determined
        by domain and type), allowed signaling among domains, and allowed process
        transitions to other domains.

      annotation: Embedding data types within other data types may result in reduced
        flow control effectiveness. Data type embedding includes inserting files as
        objects within other files and using compressed or archived data types that
        may include multiple embedded data types. Limitations on data type embedding
        consider the levels of embedding and prohibit levels of data type embedding
        that are beyond the capability of the inspection tools.

      annotation: Metadata is information that describes the characteristics of data.
        Metadata can include structural metadata describing data structures or descriptive
        metadata describing data content. Enforcement of allowed information flows
        based on metadata enables simpler and more effective flow control. Organizations
        consider the trustworthiness of metadata regarding data accuracy (i.e., knowledge
        that the metadata values are correct with respect to the data), data integrity
        (i.e., protecting against unauthorized changes to metadata tags), and the
        binding of metadata to the data payload (i.e., employing sufficiently strong
        binding techniques with appropriate assurance).

        a filter processing failure in accordance with [Assignment: organization-defined
        security or privacy policy].'
      annotation: Organization-defined security or privacy policy filters can address
        data structures and content. For example, security or privacy policy filters
        for data structures can check for maximum file lengths, maximum field sizes,
        and data/file types (for structured and unstructured data). Security or privacy
        policy filters for data content can check for specific words, enumerated values
        or data value ranges, and hidden content. Structured data permits the interpretation
        of data content by applications. Unstructured data refers to digital information
        without a data structure or with a data structure that does not facilitate
        the development of rule sets to address the impact or classification level
        of the information conveyed by the data or the flow enforcement decisions.
        Unstructured data consists of bitmap objects that are inherently non-language-based
        (i.e., image, video, or audio files) and textual objects that are based on
        written or printed languages. Organizations can implement more than one security
        or privacy policy filter to meet information flow control objectives.

      annotation: Attribution is a critical component of a security and privacy concept
        of operations. The ability to identify source and destination points for information
        flowing within systems allows the forensic reconstruction of events and encourages
        policy compliance by attributing policy violations to specific organizations
        or individuals. Successful domain authentication requires that system labels
        distinguish among systems, organizations, and individuals involved in preparing,
        sending, receiving, or disseminating information. Attribution also allows
        organizations to better maintain the lineage of personally identifiable information
        processing as it flows through systems and can facilitate consent tracking,
        as well as correction, deletion, or access requests from individuals.

      description: 'a. Identify and document [Assignment: organization-defined duties
        of individuals requiring separation]; and

        b. Define system access authorizations to support separation of duties.'
      annotation: Separation of duties addresses the potential for abuse of authorized
        privileges and helps to reduce the risk of malevolent activity without collusion.
        Separation of duties includes dividing mission or business functions and support
        functions among different individuals or roles, conducting system support
        functions with different individuals, and ensuring that security personnel
        who administer access control functions do not also administer audit functions.
        Because separation of duty violations can span systems and application domains,
        organizations consider the entirety of systems and system components when
        developing policy on separation of duties. Separation of duties is enforced
        through the account management activities in AC-2, access control mechanisms
        in AC-3, and identity management activities in IA-2, IA-4, and IA-12.

      annotation: Organizations employ least privilege for specific duties and systems.
        The principle of least privilege is also applied to system processes, ensuring
        that the processes have access to systems and operate at privilege levels
        no higher than necessary to accomplish organizational missions or business
        functions. Organizations consider the creation of additional processes, roles,
        and accounts as necessary to achieve least privilege. Organizations apply
        least privilege to the development, implementation, and operation of organizational
        systems.

      annotation: Privileged accounts, including super user accounts, are typically
        described as system administrator for various types of commercial off-the-shelf
        operating systems. Restricting privileged accounts to specific personnel or
        roles prevents day-to-day users from accessing privileged information or privileged
        functions. Organizations may differentiate in the application of restricting
        privileged accounts between allowed privileges for local accounts and for
        domain accounts provided that they retain the ability to control system configurations
        for key parameters and as otherwise necessary to sufficiently mitigate risk.

        delay algorithm]; notify system administrator; take other [Assignment: organization-defined
        action]] when the maximum number of unsuccessful attempts is exceeded.'
      annotation: The need to limit unsuccessful logon attempts and take subsequent
        action when the maximum number of attempts is exceeded applies regardless
        of whether the logon occurs via a local or network connection. Due to the
        potential for denial of service, automatic lockouts initiated by systems are
        usually temporary and automatically release after a predetermined, organization-defined
        time period. If a delay algorithm is selected, organizations may employ different
        algorithms for different components of the system based on the capabilities
        of those components. Responses to unsuccessful logon attempts may be implemented
        at the operating system and the application levels. Organization-defined actions
        that may be taken when the number of allowed consecutive invalid logon attempts
        is exceeded include prompting the user to answer a secret question in addition
        to the username and password, invoking a lockdown mode with limited user capabilities
        (instead of full lockout), allowing users to only logon from specified Internet
        Protocol (IP) addresses, requiring a CAPTCHA to prevent automated attacks,
        or applying user profiles such as location, time of day, IP address, device,
        or Media Access Control (MAC) address. If automatic system lockout or execution
        of a delay algorithm is not implemented in support of the availability objective,
        organizations consider a combination of other actions to help prevent brute
        force attacks. In addition to the above, organizations can prompt users to
        respond to a secret question before the number of allowed unsuccessful logon
        attempts is exceeded. Automatically unlocking an account after a specified
        period of time is generally not permitted. However, exceptions may be required
        based on operational mission or need.

      annotation: A mobile device is a computing device that has a small form factor
        such that it can be carried by a single individual; is designed to operate
        without a physical connection; possesses local, non-removable or removable
        data storage; and includes a self-contained power source. Purging or wiping
        the device applies only to mobile devices for which the organization-defined
        number of unsuccessful logons occurs. The logon is to the mobile device, not
        to any one account on the device. Successful logons to accounts on mobile
        devices reset the unsuccessful logon count to zero. Purging or wiping may
        be unnecessary if the information on the device is protected with sufficiently
        strong encryption mechanisms.

      annotation: Device locks are temporary actions taken to prevent logical access

        system level or at the application level. A proximity lock may be used to
        initiate the device lock (e.g., via a Bluetooth-enabled device or dongle).
        User-initiated device locking is behavior or policy-based and, as such, requires
        users to take physical action to initiate the device lock. Device locks are
        not an acceptable substitute for logging out of systems, such as when organizations
        require users to log out at the end of workdays.

      annotation: Specific user actions may be permitted without identification or
        authentication if organizations determine that identification and authentication
        are not required for the specified user actions. Organizations may allow a
        limited number of user actions without identification or authentication, including
        when individuals access public websites or other publicly accessible federal
        systems, when individuals use mobile phones to receive calls, or when facsimiles
        are received. Organizations identify actions that normally require identification
        or authentication but may, under certain circumstances, allow identification
        or authentication mechanisms to be bypassed. Such bypasses may occur, for
        example, via a software-readable physical switch that commands bypass of the
        logon functionality and is protected from accidental or unmonitored use. Permitting
        actions without identification or authentication does not apply to situations
        where identification and authentication have already occurred and are not
        repeated but rather to situations where identification and authentication
        have not yet occurred. Organizations may decide that there are no user actions
        that can be performed on organizational systems without identification and
        authentication, and therefore, the value for the assignment operation can
        be none.

      annotation: 'Information is represented internally within systems using abstractions
        known as data structures. Internal data structures can represent different
        types of entities, both active and passive. Active entities, also known as
        subjects, are typically associated with individuals, devices, or processes
        acting on behalf of individuals. Passive entities, also known as objects,
        are typically associated with data structures, such as records, buffers, tables,
        files, inter-process pipes, and communications ports. Security attributes,
        a form of metadata, are abstractions that represent the basic properties or
        characteristics of active and passive entities with respect to safeguarding
        information. Privacy attributes, which may be used independently or in conjunction
        with security attributes, represent the basic properties or characteristics
        of active or passive entities with respect to the management of personally
        identifiable information. Attributes can be either explicitly or implicitly
        associated with the information contained in organizational systems or system
        components.

        Attributes may be associated with active entities (i.e., subjects) that have
        the potential to send or receive information, cause information to flow among
        objects, or change the system state. These attributes may also be associated
        with passive entities (i.e., objects) that contain or receive information.
        The association of attributes to subjects and objects by a system is referred
        to as binding and is inclusive of setting the attribute value and the attribute
        type. Attributes, when bound to data or information, permit the enforcement
        of security and privacy policies for access control and information flow control,
        including data retention limits, permitted uses of personally identifiable
        information, and identification of personal information within data objects.
        Such enforcement occurs through organizational processes or system functions
        or mechanisms. The binding techniques implemented by systems affect the strength
        of attribute binding to information. Binding strength and the assurance associated
        with binding techniques play important parts in the trust that organizations
        have in the information flow enforcement process. The binding techniques affect
        the number and degree of additional reviews required by organizations. The
        content or assigned values of attributes can directly affect the ability of
        individuals to access organizational information.

        Organizations can define the types of attributes needed for systems to support
        missions or business functions. There are many values that can be assigned
        to a security attribute. By specifying the permitted attribute ranges and
        values, organizations ensure that attribute values are meaningful and relevant.
        Labeling refers to the association of attributes with the subjects and objects
        represented by the internal data structures within systems. This facilitates
        system-based enforcement of information security and privacy policies. Labels
        include classification of information in accordance with legal and compliance
        requirements (e.g., top secret, secret, confidential, controlled unclassified),
        information impact level; high value asset information, access authorizations,
        nationality; data life cycle protection (i.e., encryption and data expiration),
        personally identifiable information processing permissions, including individual
        consent to personally identifiable information processing, and contractor
        affiliation. A related term to labeling is marking. Marking refers to the
        association of attributes with objects in a human-readable form and displayed
        on system media. Marking enables manual, procedural, or process-based enforcement
        of information security and privacy policies. Security and privacy labels
        may have the same value as media markings (e.g., top secret, secret, confidential).
        See MP-3 (Media Marking).'

      annotation: Dynamic association of attributes is appropriate whenever the security
        or privacy characteristics of information change over time. Attributes may
        change due to information aggregation issues (i.e., characteristics of individual
        data elements are different from the combined elements), changes in individual
        access authorizations (i.e., privileges), changes in the security category
        of information, or changes in security or privacy policies. Attributes may

      description: 'Change security and privacy attributes associated with information
        only via regrading mechanisms validated using [Assignment: organization-defined
        techniques or procedures].'
      annotation: A regrading mechanism is a trusted process authorized to re-classify
        and re-label data in accordance with a defined policy exception. Validated
        regrading mechanisms are used by organizations to provide the requisite levels
        of assurance for attribute reassignment activities. The validation is facilitated
        by ensuring that regrading mechanisms are single purpose and of limited function.
        Since security and privacy attribute changes can directly affect policy enforcement
        actions, implementing trustworthy regrading mechanisms is necessary to help
        ensure that such mechanisms perform in a consistent and correct mode of operation.

        and

        b. Authorize each type of remote access to the system prior to allowing such
        connections.'
      annotation: Remote access is access to organizational systems (or processes
        acting on behalf of users) that communicate through external networks such
        as the Internet. Types of remote access include dial-up, broadband, and wireless.
        Organizations use encrypted virtual private networks (VPNs) to enhance confidentiality
        and integrity for remote connections. The use of encrypted VPNs provides sufficient
        assurance to the organization that it can effectively treat such connections
        as internal networks if the cryptographic mechanisms used are implemented
        in accordance with applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations,
        policies, standards, and guidelines. Still, VPN connections traverse external
        networks, and the encrypted VPN does not enhance the availability of remote
        connections. VPNs with encrypted tunnels can also affect the ability to adequately
        monitor network communications traffic for malicious code. Remote access controls
        apply to systems other than public web servers or systems designed for public
        access. Authorization of each remote access type addresses authorization prior
        to allowing remote access without specifying the specific formats for such
        authorization. While organizations may use information exchange and system
        connection security agreements to manage remote access connections to other
        systems, such agreements are addressed as part of CA-3. Enforcing access restrictions
        for remote access is addressed via AC-3.

        functions, or compromise of classified or controlled unclassified information.
        Authentication mechanisms for remote commands ensure that systems accept and
        execute commands in the order intended, execute only authorized commands,
        and reject unauthorized commands. Cryptographic mechanisms can be used, for
        example, to authenticate remote commands.

      description: 'a. Establish configuration requirements, connection requirements,
        and implementation guidance for organization-controlled mobile devices, to
        include when such devices are outside of controlled areas; and

        b. Authorize the connection of mobile devices to organizational systems.'
      annotation: 'A mobile device is a computing device that has a small form factor
        such that it can easily be carried by a single individual; is designed to
        operate without a physical connection; possesses local, non-removable or removable
        data storage; and includes a self-contained power source. Mobile device functionality
        may also include voice communication capabilities, on-board sensors that allow
        the device to capture information, and/or built-in features for synchronizing
        local data with remote locations. Examples include smart phones and tablets.
        Mobile devices are typically associated with a single individual. The processing,
        storage, and transmission capability of the mobile device may be comparable
        to or merely a subset of notebook/desktop systems, depending on the nature
        and intended purpose of the device. Protection and control of mobile devices
        is behavior or policy-based and requires users to take physical action to
        protect and control such devices when outside of controlled areas. Controlled
        areas are spaces for which organizations provide physical or procedural controls
        to meet the requirements established for protecting information and systems.

        Due to the large variety of mobile devices with different characteristics
        and capabilities, organizational restrictions may vary for the different classes
        or types of such devices. Usage restrictions and specific implementation guidance
        for mobile devices include configuration management, device identification
        and authentication, implementation of mandatory protective software, scanning
        devices for malicious code, updating virus protection software, scanning for
        critical software updates and patches, conducting primary operating system
        (and possibly other resident software) integrity checks, and disabling unnecessary
        hardware.

        Usage restrictions and authorization to connect may vary among organizational
        systems. For example, the organization may authorize the connection of mobile
        devices to its network and impose a set of usage restrictions, while a system
        owner may withhold authorization for mobile device connection to specific
        applications or impose additional usage restrictions before allowing mobile
        device connections to a system. Adequate security for mobile devices goes
        beyond the requirements specified in AC-19. Many safeguards for mobile devices
        are reflected in other controls. AC-20 addresses mobile devices that are not
        organization-controlled.'

        and the originating organization may be such that no explicit terms and conditions
        are required. Systems within these organizations may not be considered external.
        These situations occur when, for example, there are pre-existing information
        exchange agreements (either implicit or explicit) established between organizations
        or components or when such agreements are specified by applicable laws, executive
        orders, directives, regulations, policies, or standards. Authorized individuals
        include organizational personnel, contractors, or other individuals with authorized
        access to organizational systems and over which organizations have the authority
        to impose specific rules of behavior regarding system access. Restrictions
        that organizations impose on authorized individuals need not be uniform, as
        the restrictions may vary depending on trust relationships between organizations.
        Therefore, organizations may choose to impose different security restrictions
        on contractors than on state, local, or tribal governments.

        External systems used to access public interfaces to organizational systems
        are outside the scope of AC-20. Organizations establish specific terms and
        conditions for the use of external systems in accordance with organizational
        security policies and procedures. At a minimum, terms and conditions address
        the specific types of applications that can be accessed on organizational
        systems from external systems and the highest security category of information
        that can be processed, stored, or transmitted on external systems. If the
        terms and conditions with the owners of the external systems cannot be established,
        organizations may impose restrictions on organizational personnel using those
        external systems.'

        or system components may be allowed but restricted in some way. Restrictions
        include requiring the implementation of approved controls prior to authorizing

        Counsel regarding legal issues associated with using personally owned devices,
        including requirements for conducting forensic analyses during investigations
        after an incident.

      annotation: 'Data mining is an analytical process that attempts to find correlations
        or patterns in large data sets for the purpose of data or knowledge discovery.
        Data storage objects include database records and database fields. Sensitive
        information can be extracted from data mining operations. When information
        is personally identifiable information, it may lead to unanticipated revelations
        about individuals and give rise to privacy risks. Prior to performing data
        mining activities, organizations determine whether such activities are authorized.
        Organizations may be subject to applicable laws, executive orders, directives,
        regulations, or policies that address data mining requirements. Organizational
        personnel consult with the senior agency official for privacy and legal counsel
        regarding such requirements.

        Data mining prevention and detection techniques include limiting the number
        and frequency of database queries to increase the work factor needed to determine
        the contents of databases, limiting types of responses provided to database
        queries, applying differential privacy techniques or homomorphic encryption,
        and notifying personnel when atypical database queries or accesses occur.
        Data mining protection focuses on protecting information from data mining
        while such information resides in organizational data stores. In contrast,
        AU-13 focuses on monitoring for organizational information that may have been
        mined or otherwise obtained from data stores and is available as open-source
        information residing on external sites, such as social networking or social
        media websites.

        EO 13587 requires the establishment of an insider threat program for deterring,
        detecting, and mitigating insider threats, including the safeguarding of sensitive
        information from exploitation, compromise, or other unauthorized disclosure.
        Data mining protection requires organizations to identify appropriate techniques
        to prevent and detect unnecessary or unauthorized data mining. Data mining
        can be used by an insider to collect organizational information for the purpose
        of exfiltration.'

      annotation: Authorization processes and access control decisions may occur in
        separate parts of systems or in separate systems. In such instances, authorization
        information is transmitted securely (e.g., using cryptographic mechanisms)
        so that timely access control decisions can be enforced at the appropriate
        locations. To support the access control decisions, it may be necessary to
        transmit as part of the access authorization information supporting security
        and privacy attributes. This is because in distributed systems, there are
        various access control decisions that need to be made, and different entities
        make these decisions in a serial fashion, each requiring those attributes
        to make the decisions. Protecting access authorization information ensures
        that such information cannot be altered, spoofed, or compromised during transmission.

        is of paramount importance. In other situations, user identification information
        is simply not needed for access control decisions, and especially in the case
        of distributed systems, transmitting such information with the needed degree
        of assurance may be very expensive or difficult to accomplish. MAC, RBAC,
        ABAC, and label-based control policies, for example, might not include user
        identity as an attribute.

        to be subject to analysis and testing, the completeness of which can be assured.'
      annotation: A reference monitor is a set of design requirements on a reference
        validation mechanism that, as a key component of an operating system, enforces
        an access control policy over all subjects and objects. A reference validation
        mechanism is always invoked, tamper-proof, and small enough to be subject
        to analysis and tests, the completeness of which can be assured (i.e., verifiable).
        Information is represented internally within systems using abstractions known
        as data structures. Internal data structures can represent different types
        of entities, both active and passive. Active entities, also known as subjects,
        are associated with individuals, devices, or processes acting on behalf of
        individuals. Passive entities, also known as objects, are associated with
        data structures, such as records, buffers, communications ports, tables, files,
        and inter-process pipes. Reference monitors enforce access control policies
        that restrict access to objects based on the identity of subjects or groups
        to which the subjects belong. The system enforces the access control policy
        based on the rule set established by the policy. The tamper-proof property
        of the reference monitor prevents determined adversaries from compromising
        the functioning of the reference validation mechanism. The always invoked
        property prevents adversaries from bypassing the mechanism and violating the
        security policy. The smallness property helps to ensure completeness in the
        analysis and testing of the mechanism to detect any weaknesses or deficiencies
        (i.e., latent flaws) that would prevent the enforcement of the security policy.

        and procedures. Policies and procedures contribute to security and privacy
        assurance. Therefore, it is important that security and privacy programs collaborate
        on the development of awareness and training policy and procedures. Security
        and privacy program policies and procedures at the organization level are
        preferable, in general, and may obviate the need for mission- or system-specific
        policies and procedures. The policy can be included as part of the general
        security and privacy policy or be represented by multiple policies that reflect
        the complex nature of organizations. Procedures can be established for security
        and privacy programs, for mission or business processes, and for systems,
        if needed. Procedures describe how the policies or controls are implemented
        and can be directed at the individual or role that is the object of the procedure.
        Procedures can be documented in system security and privacy plans or in one
        or more separate documents. Events that may precipitate an update to awareness
        and training policy and procedures include assessment or audit findings, security
        incidents or breaches, or changes in applicable laws, executive orders, directives,
        regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines. Simply restating controls
        does not constitute an organizational policy or procedure.

      description: Provide literacy training on recognizing and reporting potential
        indicators of insider threat.
      annotation: Potential indicators and possible precursors of insider threat can
        include behaviors such as inordinate, long-term job dissatisfaction; attempts
        to gain access to information not required for job performance; unexplained
        access to financial resources; bullying or harassment of fellow employees;
        workplace violence; and other serious violations of policies, procedures,
        directives, regulations, rules, or practices. Literacy training includes how
        to communicate the concerns of employees and management regarding potential
        indicators of insider threat through channels established by the organization
        and in accordance with established policies and procedures. Organizations
        may consider tailoring insider threat awareness topics to the role. For example,
        training for managers may be focused on changes in the behavior of team members,
        while training for employees may be focused on more general observations.

      annotation: Social engineering is an attempt to trick an individual into revealing
        information or taking an action that can be used to breach, compromise, or
        otherwise adversely impact a system. Social engineering includes phishing,
        pretexting, impersonation, baiting, quid pro quo, thread-jacking, social media
        exploitation, and tailgating. Social mining is an attempt to gather information
        about the organization that may be used to support future attacks. Literacy
        training includes information on how to communicate the concerns of employees
        and management regarding potential and actual instances of social engineering
        and data mining through organizational channels based on established policies
        and procedures.

      description: 'Provide literacy training on recognizing suspicious communications
        and anomalous behavior in organizational systems using [Assignment: organization-defined
        indicators of malicious code].'
      annotation: A well-trained workforce provides another organizational control
        that can be employed as part of a defense-in-depth strategy to protect against
        malicious code coming into organizations via email or the web applications.
        Personnel are trained to look for indications of potentially suspicious email
        (e.g., receiving an unexpected email, receiving an email containing strange
        or poor grammar, or receiving an email from an unfamiliar sender that appears
        to be from a known sponsor or contractor). Personnel are also trained on how
        to respond to suspicious email or web communications. For this process to
        work effectively, personnel are trained and made aware of what constitutes
        suspicious communications. Training personnel on how to recognize anomalous
        behaviors in systems can provide organizations with early warning for the
        presence of malicious code. Recognition of anomalous behavior by organizational
        personnel can supplement malicious code detection and protection tools and
        systems employed by organizations.

        individuals. Threat literacy training includes educating individuals on the
        various ways that APTs can infiltrate the organization (e.g., through websites,
        emails, advertisement pop-ups, articles, and social engineering). Effective
        training includes techniques for recognizing suspicious emails, use of removable
        systems in non-secure settings, and the potential targeting of individuals
        at home.

        the training necessary for individuals to fulfill their responsibilities related
        to operations and supply chain risk management within the context of organizational
        security and privacy programs. Role-based training also applies to contractors
        who provide services to federal agencies. Types of training include web-based
        and computer-based training, classroom-style training, and hands-on training
        (including micro-training). Updating role-based training on a regular basis
        helps to ensure that the content remains relevant and effective. Events that
        may precipitate an update to role-based training content include, but are

      annotation: Audit and accountability policy and procedures address the controls
        in the AU family that are implemented within systems and organizations. The
        risk management strategy is an important factor in establishing such policies
        and procedures. Policies and procedures contribute to security and privacy
        assurance. Therefore, it is important that security and privacy programs collaborate
        on the development of audit and accountability policy and procedures. Security
        and privacy program policies and procedures at the organization level are
        preferable, in general, and may obviate the need for mission- or system-specific
        policies and procedures. The policy can be included as part of the general
        security and privacy policy or be represented by multiple policies that reflect
        the complex nature of organizations. Procedures can be established for security
        and privacy programs, for mission or business processes, and for systems,
        if needed. Procedures describe how the policies or controls are implemented
        and can be directed at the individual or role that is the object of the procedure.
        Procedures can be documented in system security and privacy plans or in one
        or more separate documents. Events that may precipitate an update to audit
        and accountability policy and procedures include assessment or audit findings,
        security incidents or breaches, or changes in applicable laws, executive orders,
        directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines. Simply restating
        controls does not constitute an organizational policy or procedure.

      annotation: 'An event is an observable occurrence in a system. The types of
        events that require logging are those events that are significant and relevant
        to the security of systems and the privacy of individuals. Event logging also
        supports specific monitoring and auditing needs. Event types include password
        changes, failed logons or failed accesses related to systems, security or
        privacy attribute changes, administrative privilege usage, PIV credential
        usage, data action changes, query parameters, or external credential usage.
        In determining the set of event types that require logging, organizations
        consider the monitoring and auditing appropriate for each of the controls
        to be implemented. For completeness, event logging includes all protocols
        that are operational and supported by the system.

        To balance monitoring and auditing requirements with other system needs, event
        logging requires identifying the subset of event types that are logged at
        a given point in time. For example, organizations may determine that systems
        need the capability to log every file access successful and unsuccessful,
        but not activate that capability except for specific circumstances due to
        the potential burden on system performance. The types of events that organizations
        desire to be logged may change. Reviewing and updating the set of logged events
        is necessary to help ensure that the events remain relevant and continue to
        support the needs of the organization. Organizations consider how the types
        of logging events can reveal information about individuals that may give rise
        to privacy risk and how best to mitigate such risks. For example, there is
        the potential to reveal personally identifiable information in the audit trail,
        especially if the logging event is based on patterns or time of usage.

        Event logging requirements, including the need to log specific event types,
        may be referenced in other controls and control enhancements. These include
        AC-2(4), AC-3(10), AC-6(9), AC-17(1), CM-3f, CM-5(1), IA-3(3)(b), MA-4(1),
        MP-4(2), PE-3, PM-21, PT-7, RA-8, SC-7(9), SC-7(15), SI-3(8), SI-4(22), SI-7(8),
        and SI-10(1). Organizations include event types that are required by applicable
        laws, executive orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and
        guidelines. Audit records can be generated at various levels, including at
        the packet level as information traverses the network. Selecting the appropriate
        level of event logging is an important part of a monitoring and auditing capability
        and can identify the root causes of problems. When defining event types, organizations
        consider the logging necessary to cover related event types, such as the steps
        in distributed, transaction-based processes and the actions that occur in
        service-oriented architectures.'

        \ and \nf. Identity of any individuals, subjects, or objects/entities associated\
        \ with the event."
      annotation: Audit record content that may be necessary to support the auditing
        function includes event descriptions (item a), time stamps (item b), source
        and destination addresses (item c), user or process identifiers (items d and
        f), success or fail indications (item e), and filenames involved (items a,
        c, e, and f) . Event outcomes include indicators of event success or failure
        and event-specific results, such as the system security and privacy posture
        after the event occurred. Organizations consider how audit records can reveal
        information about individuals that may give rise to privacy risks and how
        best to mitigate such risks. For example, there is the potential to reveal
        personally identifiable information in the audit trail, especially if the
        trail records inputs or is based on patterns or time of usage.

      description: 'Generate audit records containing the following additional information:
        [Assignment: organization-defined additional information].'
      annotation: The ability to add information generated in audit records is dependent
        on system functionality to configure the audit record content. Organizations
        may consider additional information in audit records including, but not limited
        to, access control or flow control rules invoked and individual identities
        of group account users. Organizations may also consider limiting additional
        audit record information to only information that is explicitly needed for
        audit requirements. This facilitates the use of audit trails and audit logs
        by not including information in audit records that could potentially be misleading,
        make it more difficult to locate information of interest, or increase the
        risk to individuals' privacy.

      annotation: Organizations consider the types of audit logging to be performed
        and the audit log processing requirements when allocating audit log storage
        capacity. Allocating sufficient audit log storage capacity reduces the likelihood
        of such capacity being exceeded and resulting in the potential loss or reduction

      description: 'Transfer audit logs [Assignment: organization-defined frequency]
        to a different system, system component, or media other than the system or
        system component conducting the logging.'
      annotation: Audit log transfer, also known as off-loading, is a common process
        in systems with limited audit log storage capacity and thus supports availability
        of the audit logs. The initial audit log storage is only used in a transitory
        fashion until the system can communicate with the secondary or alternate system
        allocated to audit log storage, at which point the audit logs are transferred.
        Transferring audit logs to alternate storage is similar to AU-9(2) in that
        audit logs are transferred to a different entity. However, the purpose of
        selecting AU-9(2) is to protect the confidentiality and integrity of audit
        records. Organizations can select either control enhancement to obtain the
        benefit of increased audit log storage capacity and preserving the confidentiality,
        integrity, and availability of audit records and logs.

        b. Take the following additional actions: [Assignment: organization-defined
        additional actions].'
      annotation: Audit logging process failures include software and hardware errors,
        failures in audit log capturing mechanisms, and reaching or exceeding audit
        log storage capacity. Organization-defined actions include overwriting oldest
        audit records, shutting down the system, and stopping the generation of audit
        records. Organizations may choose to define additional actions for audit logging
        process failures based on the type of failure, the location of the failure,
        the severity of the failure, or a combination of such factors. When the audit
        logging process failure is related to storage, the response is carried out
        for the audit log storage repository (i.e., the distinct system component
        where the audit logs are stored), the system on which the audit logs reside,
        the total audit log storage capacity of the organization (i.e., all audit
        log storage repositories combined), or all three. Organizations may decide
        to take no additional actions after alerting designated roles or personnel.

        the importance of ensuring mission and business continuity, organizations
        may determine that the nature of the audit logging failure is not so severe

      annotation: Integrated analysis of audit records does not require vulnerability
        scanning, the generation of performance data, or system monitoring. Rather,
        integrated analysis requires that the analysis of information generated by
        scanning, monitoring, or other data collection activities is integrated with
        the analysis of audit record information. Security Information and Event Management
        tools can facilitate audit record aggregation or consolidation from multiple
        system components as well as audit record correlation and analysis. The use
        of standardized audit record analysis scripts developed by organizations (with
        localized script adjustments, as necessary) provides more cost-effective approaches
        for analyzing audit record information collected. The correlation of audit
        record information with vulnerability scanning information is important in
        determining the veracity of vulnerability scans of the system and in correlating
        attack detection events with scanning results. Correlation with performance
        data can uncover denial-of-service attacks or other types of attacks that
        result in the unauthorized use of resources. Correlation with system monitoring
        information can assist in uncovering attacks and in better relating audit
        information to operational situations.

        The correlation of information from nontechnical sources with audit record
        information generally occurs only when individuals are suspected of being

      annotation: Time stamps generated by the system include date and time. Time
        is commonly expressed in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), a modern continuation
        of Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), or local time with an offset from UTC. Granularity
        of time measurements refers to the degree of synchronization between system
        clocks and reference clocks (e.g., clocks synchronizing within hundreds of
        milliseconds or tens of milliseconds). Organizations may define different
        time granularities for different system components. Time service can be critical
        to other security capabilities such as access control and identification and
        authentication, depending on the nature of the mechanisms used to support
        those capabilities.

        protects against claims by authors of not having authored certain documents,
        senders of not having transmitted messages, receivers of not having received
        messages, and signatories of not having signed documents. Non-repudiation

        a contract, approving a procurement request, or receiving specific information).
        Organizations obtain non-repudiation services by employing various techniques
        or mechanisms, including digital signatures and digital message receipts.

      annotation: Chain of custody is a process that tracks the movement of evidence
        through its collection, safeguarding, and analysis life cycle by documenting
        each individual who handled the evidence, the date and time the evidence was
        collected or transferred, and the purpose for the transfer. If the reviewer
        is a human or if the review function is automated but separate from the release
        or transfer function, the system associates the identity of the reviewer of
        the information to be released with the information and the information label.
        In the case of human reviews, maintaining the credentials of reviewers or
        releasers provides the organization with the means to identify who reviewed
        and released the information. In the case of automated reviews, it ensures
        that only approved review functions are used.

        Therefore, it is often the case that cross-organizational audit logging simply
        captures the identity of individuals who issue requests at the initial system,
        and subsequent systems record that the requests originated from authorized
        individuals. Organizations consider including processes for coordinating audit
        information requirements and protection of audit information in information
        exchange agreements.

        establishing such policies and procedures. Policies and procedures contribute
        to security and privacy assurance. Therefore, it is important that security
        and privacy programs collaborate on the development of assessment, authorization,
        and monitoring policy and procedures. Security and privacy program policies
        and procedures at the organization level are preferable, in general, and may
        obviate the need for mission- or system-specific policies and procedures.
        The policy can be included as part of the general security and privacy policy
        or be represented by multiple policies that reflect the complex nature of
        organizations. Procedures can be established for security and privacy programs,
        for mission or business processes, and for systems, if needed. Procedures
        describe how the policies or controls are implemented and can be directed
        at the individual or role that is the object of the procedure. Procedures
        can be documented in system security and privacy plans or in one or more separate
        documents. Events that may precipitate an update to assessment, authorization,
        and monitoring policy and procedures include assessment or audit findings,
        security incidents or breaches, or changes in applicable laws, executive orders,
        directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines. Simply restating
        controls does not constitute an organizational policy or procedure.

        and

        f. Provide the results of the control assessment to [Assignment: organization-defined

      annotation: 'Organizations ensure that control assessors possess the required
        skills and technical expertise to develop effective assessment plans and to
        conduct assessments of system-specific, hybrid, common, and program management
        controls, as appropriate. The required skills include general knowledge of
        risk management concepts and approaches as well as comprehensive knowledge
        of and experience with the hardware, software, and firmware system components
        implemented.

        Organizations assess controls in systems and the environments in which those
        systems operate as part of initial and ongoing authorizations, continuous
        monitoring, FISMA annual assessments, system design and development, systems
        security engineering, privacy engineering, and the system development life
        cycle. Assessments help to ensure that organizations meet information security
        and privacy requirements, identify weaknesses and deficiencies in the system
        design and development process, provide essential information needed to make
        risk-based decisions as part of authorization processes, and comply with vulnerability
        mitigation procedures. Organizations conduct assessments on the implemented
        controls as documented in security and privacy plans. Assessments can also
        be conducted throughout the system development life cycle as part of systems
        engineering and systems security engineering processes. The design for controls
        can be assessed as RFPs are developed, responses assessed, and design reviews
        conducted. If a design to implement controls and subsequent implementation
        in accordance with the design are assessed during development, the final control
        testing can be a simple confirmation utilizing previously completed control
        assessment and aggregating the outcomes.

        Organizations may develop a single, consolidated security and privacy assessment
        plan for the system or maintain separate plans. A consolidated assessment
        plan clearly delineates the roles and responsibilities for control assessment.
        If multiple organizations participate in assessing a system, a coordinated
        approach can reduce redundancies and associated costs.

        Organizations can use other types of assessment activities, such as vulnerability
        scanning and system monitoring, to maintain the security and privacy posture
        of systems during the system life cycle. Assessment reports document assessment
        results in sufficient detail, as deemed necessary by organizations, to determine
        the accuracy and completeness of the reports and whether the controls are
        implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome
        with respect to meeting requirements. Assessment results are provided to the
        individuals or roles appropriate for the types of assessments being conducted.
        For example, assessments conducted in support of authorization decisions are
        provided to authorizing officials, senior agency officials for privacy, senior
        agency information security officers, and authorizing official designated
        representatives.

        To satisfy annual assessment requirements, organizations can use assessment
        results from the following sources: initial or ongoing system authorizations,
        continuous monitoring, systems engineering processes, or system development
        life cycle activities. Organizations ensure that assessment results are current,
        relevant to the determination of control effectiveness, and obtained with
        the appropriate level of assessor independence. Existing control assessment
        results can be reused to the extent that the results are still valid and can
        also be supplemented with additional assessments as needed. After the initial
        authorizations, organizations assess controls during continuous monitoring.
        Organizations also establish the frequency for ongoing assessments in accordance
        with organizational continuous monitoring strategies. External audits, including
        audits by external entities such as regulatory agencies, are outside of the
        scope of CA-2.'

      description: Employ independent assessors or assessment teams to conduct control
        assessments.
      annotation: 'Independent assessors or assessment teams are individuals or groups
        who conduct impartial assessments of systems. Impartiality means that assessors
        are free from any perceived or actual conflicts of interest regarding the
        development, operation, sustainment, or management of the systems under assessment
        or the determination of control effectiveness. To achieve impartiality, assessors
        do not create a mutual or conflicting interest with the organizations where
        the assessments are being conducted, assess their own work, act as management
        or employees of the organizations they are serving, or place themselves in
        positions of advocacy for the organizations acquiring their services.

        Independent assessments can be obtained from elements within organizations
        or be contracted to public or private sector entities outside of organizations.
        Authorizing officials determine the required level of independence based on
        the security categories of systems and/or the risk to organizational operations,
        organizational assets, or individuals. Authorizing officials also determine
        if the level of assessor independence provides sufficient assurance that the
        results are sound and can be used to make credible, risk-based decisions.
        Assessor independence determination includes whether contracted assessment
        services have sufficient independence, such as when system owners are not
        directly involved in contracting processes or cannot influence the impartiality
        of the assessors conducting the assessments. During the system design and
        development phase, having independent assessors is analogous to having independent
        SMEs involved in design reviews.

        When organizations that own the systems are small or the structures of the
        organizations require that assessments be conducted by individuals that are
        in the developmental, operational, or management chain of the system owners,
        independence in assessment processes can be achieved by ensuring that assessment
        results are carefully reviewed and analyzed by independent teams of experts
        to validate the completeness, accuracy, integrity, and reliability of the
        results. Assessments performed for purposes other than to support authorization
        decisions are more likely to be useable for such decisions when performed
        by assessors with sufficient independence, thereby reducing the need to repeat
        assessments.'

      annotation: 'System information exchange requirements apply to information exchanges
        between two or more systems. System information exchanges include connections
        via leased lines or virtual private networks, connections to internet service
        providers, database sharing or exchanges of database transaction information,
        connections and exchanges with cloud services, exchanges via web-based services,
        or exchanges of files via file transfer protocols, network protocols (e.g.,
        IPv4, IPv6), email, or other organization-to-organization communications.
        Organizations consider the risk related to new or increased threats that may
        be introduced when systems exchange information with other systems that may
        have different security and privacy requirements and controls. This includes
        systems within the same organization and systems that are external to the
        organization. A joint authorization of the systems exchanging information,
        as described in CA-6(1) or CA-6(2), may help to communicate and reduce risk.

        Authorizing officials determine the risk associated with system information
        exchange and the controls needed for appropriate risk mitigation. The types
        of agreements selected are based on factors such as the impact level of the
        information being exchanged, the relationship between the organizations exchanging
        information (e.g., government to government, government to business, business
        to business, government or business to service provider, government or business
        to individual), or the level of access to the organizational system by users
        of the other system. If systems that exchange information have the same authorizing
        official, organizations need not develop agreements. Instead, the interface
        characteristics between the systems (e.g., how the information is being exchanged.
        how the information is protected) are described in the respective security
        and privacy plans. If the systems that exchange information have different
        authorizing officials within the same organization, the organizations can
        develop agreements or provide the same information that would be provided
        in the appropriate agreement type from CA-3a in the respective security and
        privacy plans for the systems. Organizations may incorporate agreement information
        into formal contracts, especially for information exchanges established between
        federal agencies and nonfederal organizations (including service providers,
        contractors, system developers, and system integrators). Risk considerations
        include systems that share the same networks.'

      annotation: Transitive or downstream information exchanges are information exchanges
        between the system or systems with which the organizational system exchanges
        information and other systems. For mission-essential systems, services, and

        in place in such downstream systems connected directly or indirectly to organizational
        systems is essential to understanding the security and privacy risks resulting
        from those information exchanges. Organizational systems can inherit risk
        from downstream systems through transitive connections and information exchanges,
        which can make the organizational systems more susceptible to threats, hazards,
        and adverse impacts.

        on the implementation of agreed-upon controls. Authorizing officials provide
        budgetary oversight for organizational systems and common controls or assume
        responsibility for the mission and business functions supported by those systems
        or common controls. The authorization process is a federal responsibility,
        and therefore, authorizing officials must be federal employees. Authorizing
        officials are both responsible and accountable for security and privacy risks
        associated with the operation and use of organizational systems. Nonfederal
        organizations may have similar processes to authorize systems and senior officials
        that assume the authorization role and associated responsibilities.

        Authorizing officials issue ongoing authorizations of systems based on evidence
        produced from implemented continuous monitoring programs. Robust continuous
        monitoring programs reduce the need for separate reauthorization processes.
        Through the employment of comprehensive continuous monitoring processes, the
        information contained in authorization packages (i.e., security and privacy
        plans, assessment reports, and plans of action and milestones) is updated

        assess and monitor their controls and risks at a frequency sufficient to support
        risk-based decisions. Different types of controls may require different monitoring
        frequencies. The results of continuous monitoring generate risk response actions
        by organizations. When monitoring the effectiveness of multiple controls that
        have been grouped into capabilities, a root-cause analysis may be needed to
        determine the specific control that has failed. Continuous monitoring programs
        allow organizations to maintain the authorizations of systems and common controls
        in highly dynamic environments of operation with changing mission and business
        needs, threats, vulnerabilities, and technologies. Having access to security
        and privacy information on a continuing basis through reports and dashboards

        management decisions, including ongoing authorization decisions.

        Automation supports more frequent updates to hardware, software, and firmware
        inventories, authorization packages, and other system information. Effectiveness
        is further enhanced when continuous monitoring outputs are formatted to provide
        information that is specific, measurable, actionable, relevant, and timely.

      description: 'Conduct penetration testing [Assignment: organization-defined
        frequency] on [Assignment: organization-defined systems or system components].'
      annotation: 'Penetration testing is a specialized type of assessment conducted
        on systems or individual system components to identify vulnerabilities that
        could be exploited by adversaries. Penetration testing goes beyond automated
        vulnerability scanning and is conducted by agents and teams with demonstrable
        skills and experience that include technical expertise in network, operating
        system, and/or application level security. Penetration testing can be used
        to validate vulnerabilities or determine the degree of penetration resistance
        of systems to adversaries within specified constraints. Such constraints include
        time, resources, and skills. Penetration testing attempts to duplicate the
        actions of adversaries and provides a more in-depth analysis of security-
        and privacy-related weaknesses or deficiencies. Penetration testing is especially
        important when organizations are transitioning from older technologies to
        newer technologies (e.g., transitioning from IPv4 to IPv6 network protocols).

        Organizations can use the results of vulnerability analyses to support penetration
        testing activities. Penetration testing can be conducted internally or externally
        on the hardware, software, or firmware components of a system and can exercise
        both physical and technical controls. A standard method for penetration testing
        includes a pretest analysis based on full knowledge of the system, pretest
        identification of potential vulnerabilities based on the pretest analysis,
        and testing designed to determine the exploitability of vulnerabilities. All
        parties agree to the rules of engagement before commencing penetration testing
        scenarios. Organizations correlate the rules of engagement for the penetration
        tests with the tools, techniques, and procedures that are anticipated to be
        employed by adversaries. Penetration testing may result in the exposure of
        information that is protected by laws or regulations, to individuals conducting
        the testing. Rules of engagement, contracts, or other appropriate mechanisms
        can be used to communicate expectations for how to protect this information.
        Risk assessments guide the decisions on the level of independence required
        for the personnel conducting penetration testing.'

        rules of engagement: [Assignment: organization-defined red team exercises].'
      annotation: Red team exercises extend the objectives of penetration testing
        by examining the security and privacy posture of organizations and the capability
        to implement effective cyber defenses. Red team exercises simulate attempts
        by adversaries to compromise mission and business functions and provide a
        comprehensive assessment of the security and privacy posture of systems and
        organizations. Such attempts may include technology-based attacks and social
        engineering-based attacks. Technology-based attacks include interactions with
        hardware, software, or firmware components and/or mission and business processes.
        Social engineering-based attacks include interactions via email, telephone,
        shoulder surfing, or personal conversations. Red team exercises are most effective
        when conducted by penetration testing agents and teams with knowledge of and
        experience with current adversarial tactics, techniques, procedures, and tools.
        While penetration testing may be primarily laboratory-based testing, organizations
        can use red team exercises to provide more comprehensive assessments that
        reflect real-world conditions. The results from red team exercises can be
        used by organizations to improve security and privacy awareness and training
        and to assess control effectiveness.

      annotation: Configuration management policy and procedures address the controls
        in the CM family that are implemented within systems and organizations. The
        risk management strategy is an important factor in establishing such policies
        and procedures. Policies and procedures contribute to security and privacy
        assurance. Therefore, it is important that security and privacy programs collaborate
        on the development of configuration management policy and procedures. Security
        and privacy program policies and procedures at the organization level are
        preferable, in general, and may obviate the need for mission- or system-specific
        policies and procedures. The policy can be included as part of the general
        security and privacy policy or be represented by multiple policies that reflect
        the complex nature of organizations. Procedures can be established for security
        and privacy programs, for mission/business processes, and for systems, if
        needed. Procedures describe how the policies or controls are implemented and
        can be directed at the individual or role that is the object of the procedure.
        Procedures can be documented in system security and privacy plans or in one
        or more separate documents. Events that may precipitate an update to configuration
        management policy and procedures include, but are not limited to, assessment
        or audit findings, security incidents or breaches, or changes in applicable
        laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and
        guidelines. Simply restating controls does not constitute an organizational
        policy or procedure.

      annotation: Establishing separate baseline configurations for development, testing,
        and operational environments protects systems from unplanned or unexpected
        events related to development and testing activities. Separate baseline configurations
        allow organizations to apply the configuration management that is most appropriate
        for each type of configuration. For example, the management of operational
        configurations typically emphasizes the need for stability, while the management
        of development or test configurations requires greater flexibility. Configurations
        in the test environment mirror configurations in the operational environment
        to the extent practicable so that the results of the testing are representative
        of the proposed changes to the operational systems. Separate baseline configurations
        do not necessarily require separate physical environments.

        to counter the increased threat in such areas. For example, organizations
        can take actions for notebook computers used by individuals departing on and
        returning from travel. Actions include determining the locations that are
        of concern, defining the required configurations for the components, ensuring
        that components are configured as intended before travel is initiated, and
        applying controls to the components after travel is completed. Specially configured
        notebook computers include computers with sanitized hard drives, limited applications,
        and more stringent configuration settings. Controls applied to mobile devices
        upon return from travel include examining the mobile device for signs of physical
        tampering and purging and reimaging disk drives. Protecting information that

        officials for privacy, or system privacy officers. Representation by personnel
        with information security and privacy expertise is important because changes
        to system configurations can have unintended side effects, some of which may
        be security- or privacy-relevant. Detecting such changes early in the process
        can help avoid unintended, negative consequences that could ultimately affect
        the security and privacy posture of systems. The configuration change control
        element referred to in the second organization-defined parameter reflects
        the change control elements defined by organizations in CM-3g.

      annotation: A separate test environment requires an environment that is physically
        or logically separate and distinct from the operational environment. The separation
        is sufficient to ensure that activities in the test environment do not impact
        activities in the operational environment and that information in the operational
        environment is not inadvertently transmitted to the test environment. Separate
        environments can be achieved by physical or logical means. If physically separate
        test environments are not implemented, organizations determine the strength
        of mechanism required when implementing logical separation.

        the hardware, software, or firmware components of the system that affect the
        security and privacy posture or functionality of the system. Information technology
        products for which configuration settings can be defined include mainframe
        computers, servers, workstations, operating systems, mobile devices, input/output
        devices, protocols, and applications. Parameters that impact the security
        posture of systems include registry settings; account, file, or directory
        permission settings; and settings for functions, protocols, ports, services,
        and remote connections. Privacy parameters are parameters impacting the privacy
        posture of systems, including the parameters required to satisfy other privacy
        controls. Privacy parameters include settings for access controls, data processing
        preferences, and processing and retention permissions. Organizations establish
        organization-wide configuration settings and subsequently derive specific
        configuration settings for systems. The established settings become part of
        the configuration baseline for the system.

        Common secure configurations (also known as security configuration checklists,
        lockdown and hardening guides, and security reference guides) provide recognized,
        standardized, and established benchmarks that stipulate secure configuration
        settings for information technology products and platforms as well as instructions
        for configuring those products or platforms to meet operational requirements.
        Common secure configurations can be developed by a variety of organizations,
        including information technology product developers, manufacturers, vendors,
        federal agencies, consortia, academia, industry, and other organizations in
        the public and private sectors.

        Implementation of a common secure configuration may be mandated at the organization
        level, mission and business process level, system level, or at a higher level,
        including by a regulatory agency. Common secure configurations include the
        United States Government Configuration Baseline USGCB and security technical
        implementation guides (STIGs), which affect the implementation of CM-6 and
        other controls such as AC-19 and CM-7. The Security Content Automation Protocol
        (SCAP) and the defined standards within the protocol provide an effective
        method to uniquely identify, track, and control configuration settings.'

      annotation: Systems provide a wide variety of functions and services. Some of
        the functions and services routinely provided by default may not be necessary
        to support essential organizational missions, functions, or operations. Additionally,
        it is sometimes convenient to provide multiple services from a single system
        component, but doing so increases risk over limiting the services provided
        by that single component. Where feasible, organizations limit component functionality
        to a single function per component. Organizations consider removing unused
        or unnecessary software and disabling unused or unnecessary physical and logical
        ports and protocols to prevent unauthorized connection of components, transfer
        of information, and tunneling. Organizations employ network scanning tools,
        intrusion detection and prevention systems, and end-point protection technologies,
        such as firewalls and host-based intrusion detection systems, to identify
        and prevent the use of prohibited functions, protocols, ports, and services.

        the older and newer technologies simultaneously during the transition period
        and returning to minimum essential functions, ports, protocols, and services
        at the earliest opportunity. Organizations can either decide the relative
        security of the function, port, protocol, and/or service or base the security

      annotation: Authorized software programs can be limited to specific versions
        or from a specific source. To facilitate a comprehensive authorized software
        process and increase the strength of protection for attacks that bypass application
        level authorized software, software programs may be decomposed into and monitored
        at different levels of detail. These levels include applications, application
        programming interfaces, application modules, scripts, system processes, system
        services, kernel functions, registries, drivers, and dynamic link libraries.
        The concept of permitting the execution of authorized software may also be
        applied to user actions, system ports and protocols, IP addresses/ranges,
        websites, and MAC addresses. Organizations consider verifying the integrity
        of authorized software programs using digital signatures, cryptographic checksums,
        or hash functions. Verification of authorized software can occur either prior
        to execution or at system startup. The identification of authorized URLs for
        websites is addressed in CA-3(5) and SC-7.

        effective system component accountability]; and

        b. Review and update the system component inventory [Assignment: organization-defined

      annotation: 'System components are discrete, identifiable information technology
        assets that include hardware, software, and firmware. Organizations may choose
        to implement centralized system component inventories that include components
        from all organizational systems. In such situations, organizations ensure
        that the inventories include system-specific information required for component
        accountability. The information necessary for effective accountability of
        system components includes the system name, software owners, software version
        numbers, hardware inventory specifications, software license information,
        and for networked components, the machine names and network addresses across
        all implemented protocols (e.g., IPv4, IPv6). Inventory specifications include
        date of receipt, cost, model, serial number, manufacturer, supplier information,
        component type,  and physical location.

        Preventing duplicate accounting of system components addresses the lack of
        accountability that occurs when component ownership and system association
        is not known, especially in large or complex connected systems. Effective
        prevention of duplicate accounting of system components necessitates use of
        a unique identifier for each component. For software inventory, centrally
        managed software that is accessed via other systems is addressed as a component
        of the system on which it is installed and managed. Software installed on
        multiple organizational systems and managed at the system level is addressed
        for each individual system and may appear more than once in a centralized
        component inventory, necessitating a system association for each software
        instance in the centralized inventory to avoid duplicate accounting of components.
        Scanning systems implementing multiple network protocols (e.g., IPv4 and IPv6)
        can result in duplicate components being identified in different address spaces.
        The implementation of CM-8(7) can help to eliminate duplicate accounting of
        components.'

      annotation: Organizations maintain system inventories to the extent feasible.
        For example, virtual machines can be difficult to monitor because such machines
        are not visible to the network when not in use. In such cases, organizations
        maintain as up-to-date, complete, and accurate an inventory as is deemed reasonable.

      annotation: Automated unauthorized component detection is applied in addition
        to the monitoring for unauthorized remote connections and mobile devices.
        Monitoring for unauthorized system components may be accomplished on an ongoing
        basis or by the periodic scanning of systems for that purpose. Automated mechanisms
        may also be used to prevent the connection of unauthorized components (see
        CM-7(9)). Automated mechanisms can be implemented in systems or in separate
        system components. When acquiring and implementing automated mechanisms, organizations
        consider whether such mechanisms depend on the ability of the system component
        to support an agent or supplicant in order to be detected since some types
        of components do not have or cannot support agents (e.g., IoT devices, sensors).
        Isolation can be achieved , for example, by placing unauthorized system components
        in separate domains or subnets or quarantining such components. This type
        of  component isolation is commonly referred to as sandboxing.

        activities (e.g., the control of code and software libraries) and operational
        configuration management activities (e.g., control of installed components
        and how the components are configured). Configuration management plans satisfy
        the requirements in configuration management policies while being tailored
        to individual systems. Configuration management plans define processes and
        procedures for how configuration management is used to support system development
        life cycle activities.

        Configuration management plans are generated during the development and acquisition
        stage of the system development life cycle. The plans describe how to advance
        changes through change management processes; update configuration settings
        and baselines; maintain component inventories; control development, test,
        and operational environments; and develop, release, and update key documents.

        Organizations can employ templates to help ensure the consistent and timely
        development and implementation of configuration management plans. Templates
        can represent a configuration management plan for the organization with subsets
        of the plan implemented on a system by system basis. Configuration management

        community associated with the software that inspects, tests,  updates, and
        reports on issues found in software on an ongoing basis. However, remediating
        vulnerabilities in open-source software may be problematic. There may also
        be licensing issues associated with open-source software, including the constraints
        on derivative use of such software. Open-source software that is available

        specific information types and information reside in system components and
        how information is being processed so that information flow can be understood
        and adequate protection and policy management provided for such information
        and system components. The security category of the information is also a
        factor in determining the controls necessary to protect the information and
        the system component where the information resides (see FIPS 199). The location
        of the information and system components is also a factor in the architecture
        and design of the system (see SA-4, SA-8, SA-17).

      name: Data Action Mapping
      description: Develop and document a map of system data actions.
      annotation: Data actions are system operations that process personally identifiable
        information. The processing of such information encompasses the full information
        life cycle, which includes collection, generation, transformation, use, disclosure,
        retention, and disposal. A map of system data actions includes discrete data
        actions, elements of personally identifiable information being processed in
        the data actions, system components involved in the data actions, and the
        owners or operators of the system components. Understanding what personally
        identifiable information is being processed (e.g., the sensitivity of the
        personally identifiable information), how personally identifiable information
        is being processed (e.g., if the data action is visible to the individual
        or is processed in another part of the system), and by whom (e.g., individuals
        may have different privacy perceptions based on the entity that is processing
        the personally identifiable information) provides a number of contextual factors
        that are important to assessing the degree of privacy risk created by the
        system. Data maps can be illustrated in different ways, and the level of detail
        may vary based on the mission and business needs of the organization. The
        data map may be an overlay of any system design artifact that the organization
        is using. The development of this map may necessitate coordination between
        the privacy and security programs regarding the covered data actions and the
        components that are identified as part of the system.

      annotation: Contingency planning policy and procedures address the controls
        in the CP family that are implemented within systems and organizations. The
        risk management strategy is an important factor in establishing such policies
        and procedures. Policies and procedures contribute to security and privacy
        assurance. Therefore, it is important that security and privacy programs collaborate
        on the development of contingency planning policy and procedures. Security
        and privacy program policies and procedures at the organization level are
        preferable, in general, and may obviate the need for mission- or system-specific
        policies and procedures. The policy can be included as part of the general
        security and privacy policy or be represented by multiple policies that reflect
        the complex nature of organizations. Procedures can be established for security
        and privacy programs, for mission or business processes, and for systems,
        if needed. Procedures describe how the policies or controls are implemented
        and can be directed at the individual or role that is the object of the procedure.
        Procedures can be documented in system security and privacy plans or in one
        or more separate documents. Events that may precipitate an update to contingency
        planning policy and procedures include assessment or audit findings, security
        incidents or breaches, or changes in laws, executive orders, directives, regulations,
        policies, standards, and guidelines. Simply restating controls does not constitute
        an organizational policy or procedure.

      annotation: 'Contingency planning for systems is part of an overall program
        for achieving continuity of operations for organizational mission and business
        functions. Contingency planning addresses system restoration and implementation
        of alternative mission or business processes when systems are compromised
        or breached. Contingency planning is considered throughout the system development
        life cycle and is a fundamental part of the system design. Systems can be
        designed for redundancy, to provide backup capabilities, and for resilience.
        Contingency plans reflect the degree of restoration required for organizational
        systems since not all systems need to fully recover to achieve the level of
        continuity of operations desired. System recovery objectives reflect applicable
        laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, guidelines,
        organizational risk tolerance, and system impact level.

        Actions addressed in contingency plans include orderly system degradation,
        system shutdown, fallback to a manual mode, alternate information flows, and
        operating in modes reserved for when systems are under attack. By coordinating
        contingency planning with incident handling activities, organizations ensure
        that the necessary planning activities are in place and activated in the event
        of an incident. Organizations consider whether continuity of operations during
        an incident conflicts with the capability to automatically disable the system,
        as specified in IR-4(5). Incident response planning is part of contingency
        planning for organizations and is addressed in the IR (Incident Response)
        family.'

      description: Coordinate contingency plan testing with organizational elements
        responsible for related plans.
      annotation: Plans related to contingency planning for organizational systems
        include Business Continuity Plans, Disaster Recovery Plans, Continuity of
        Operations Plans, Crisis Communications Plans, Critical Infrastructure Plans,
        Cyber Incident Response Plans, and Occupant Emergency Plans. Coordination
        of contingency plan testing does not require organizations to create organizational
        elements to handle related plans or to align such elements with specific plans.
        However, it does require that if such organizational elements are responsible
        for related plans, organizations coordinate with those elements.

      annotation: Often, the best method of assessing system resilience is to disrupt
        the system in some manner. The mechanisms used by the organization could disrupt
        system functions or system services in many ways, including terminating or
        disabling critical system components, changing the configuration of system
        components, degrading critical functionality (e.g., restricting network bandwidth),
        or altering privileges. Automated, on-going, and simulated cyber-attacks and
        service disruptions can reveal unexpected functional dependencies and help
        the organization determine its ability to ensure resilience in the face of
        an actual cyber-attack.

      annotation: Organizations consider the potential mission or business impact
        in situations where telecommunications service providers are servicing other
        organizations with similar priority of service provisions. Telecommunications
        Service Priority (TSP) is a Federal Communications Commission (FCC) program
        that directs telecommunications service providers (e.g., wireline and wireless
        phone companies) to give preferential treatment to users enrolled in the program
        when they need to add new lines or have their lines restored following a disruption
        of service, regardless of the cause. The FCC sets the rules and policies for
        the TSP program, and the Department of Homeland Security manages the TSP program.
        The TSP program is always in effect and not contingent on a major disaster
        or attack taking place. Federal sponsorship is required to enroll in the TSP
        program.

        the backup information is stored, the operations used to retrieve the information,
        and the integrity of the information being retrieved. Independent and specialized
        tests can be used for each of the aspects of reliability. For example, decrypting
        and transporting (or transmitting) a random sample of backup files from the
        alternate storage or backup site and comparing the information to the same
        information at the primary processing site can provide such assurance.

        storage sites, including geographically distributed architectures, serve as
        separate storage facilities for organizations. Organizations may provide separate
        storage by implementing automated backup processes at alternative storage
        sites (e.g., data centers). The General Services Administration (GSA) establishes
        standards and specifications for security and fire rated containers.

        The risk management strategy is an important factor in establishing such policies
        and procedures. Policies and procedures contribute to security and privacy
        assurance. Therefore, it is important that security and privacy programs collaborate
        on the development of identification and authentication policy and procedures.
        Security and privacy program policies and procedures at the organization level
        are preferable, in general, and may obviate the need for mission- or system-specific
        policies and procedures. The policy can be included as part of the general
        security and privacy policy or be represented by multiple policies that reflect
        the complex nature of organizations. Procedures can be established for security
        and privacy programs, for mission or business processes, and for systems,
        if needed. Procedures describe how the policies or controls are implemented
        and can be directed at the individual or role that is the object of the procedure.
        Procedures can be documented in system security and privacy plans or in one
        or more separate documents. Events that may precipitate an update to identification
        and authentication policy and procedures include assessment or audit findings,
        security incidents or breaches, or changes in applicable laws, executive orders,
        directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines. Simply restating
        controls does not constitute an organizational policy or procedure.

      annotation: 'Organizations can satisfy the identification and authentication
        requirements by complying with the requirements in HSPD 12. Organizational
        users include employees or individuals who organizations consider to have
        an equivalent status to employees (e.g., contractors and guest researchers).
        Unique identification and authentication of users applies to all accesses
        other than those that are explicitly identified in AC-14 and that occur through
        the authorized use of group authenticators without individual authentication.
        Since processes execute on behalf of groups and roles, organizations may require
        unique identification of individuals in group accounts or for detailed accountability
        of individual activity.

        Organizations employ passwords, physical authenticators, or biometrics to
        authenticate user identities or, in the case of multi-factor authentication,
        some combination thereof. Access to organizational systems is defined as either
        local access or network access. Local access is any access to organizational
        systems by users or processes acting on behalf of users, where access is obtained
        through direct connections without the use of networks. Network access is
        access to organizational systems by users (or processes acting on behalf of
        users) where access is obtained through network connections (i.e., nonlocal
        accesses). Remote access is a type of network access that involves communication
        through external networks. Internal networks include local area networks and
        wide area networks.

        The use of encrypted virtual private networks for network connections between
        organization-controlled endpoints and non-organization-controlled endpoints
        may be treated as internal networks with respect to protecting the confidentiality
        and integrity of information traversing the network. Identification and authentication

      annotation: The purpose of requiring a device that is separate from the system

        such authenticators or credentials and subsequently impersonate authorized
        users. Implementing one of the factors on a separate device (e.g., a hardware

      annotation: Devices that require unique device-to-device identification and

        Organization-defined device types include devices that are not owned by the
        organization. Systems use shared known information (e.g., Media Access Control
        [MAC], Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol [TCP/IP] addresses)
        for device identification or organizational authentication solutions (e.g.,
        Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 802.1x and Extensible
        Authentication Protocol [EAP], RADIUS server with EAP-Transport Layer Security
        [TLS] authentication, Kerberos) to identify and authenticate devices on local
        and wide area networks. Organizations determine the required strength of authentication
        mechanisms based on the security categories of systems and mission or business
        requirements. Because of the challenges of implementing device authentication
        on a large scale, organizations can restrict the application of the control
        to a limited number/type of devices based on mission or business needs.

      annotation: Password-based authentication applies to passwords regardless of
        whether they are used in single-factor or multi-factor authentication. Long
        passwords or passphrases are preferable over shorter passwords. Enforced composition
        rules provide marginal security benefits while decreasing usability. However,
        organizations may choose to establish certain rules for password generation
        (e.g., minimum character length for long passwords) under certain circumstances
        and can enforce this requirement in IA-5(1)(h). Account recovery can occur,
        for example, in situations when a password is forgotten. Cryptographically
        protected passwords include salted one-way cryptographic hashes of passwords.
        The list of commonly used, compromised, or expected passwords includes passwords
        obtained from previous breach corpuses, dictionary words, and repetitive or
        sequential characters. The list includes context-specific words, such as the
        name of the service, username, and derivatives thereof.

      annotation: Public key cryptography is a valid authentication mechanism for

        for certification paths includes certificate revocation lists or certificate
        status protocol responses. For PIV cards, certificate validation involves
        the construction and verification of a certification path to the Common Policy
        Root trust anchor, which includes certificate policy processing. Implementing
        a local cache of revocation data to support path discovery and validation
        also supports system availability in situations where organizations are unable
        to access revocation information via the network.

      description: 'Bind identities and authenticators dynamically using the following
        rules: [Assignment: organization-defined binding rules].'
      annotation: Authentication requires some form of binding between an identity
        and the authenticator that is used to confirm the identity. In conventional
        approaches, binding is established by pre-provisioning both the identity and
        the authenticator to the system. For example, the binding between a username
        (i.e., identity) and a password (i.e., authenticator) is accomplished by provisioning
        the identity and authenticator as a pair in the system. New authentication
        techniques allow the binding between the identity and the authenticator to
        be implemented external to a system. For example, with smartcard credentials,
        the identity and authenticator are bound together on the smartcard. Using
        these credentials, systems can authenticate identities that have not been
        pre-provisioned, dynamically provisioning the identity after authentication.
        In these situations, organizations can anticipate the dynamic provisioning
        of identities. Pre-established trust relationships and mechanisms with appropriate
        authorities to validate identities and related credentials are essential.

      annotation: Unlike password-based authentication, which provides exact matches
        of user-input passwords to stored passwords, biometric authentication does
        not provide exact matches. Depending on the type of biometric and the type
        of collection mechanism, there is likely to be some divergence from the presented
        biometric and the stored biometric that serves as the basis for comparison.

        results in a match for a genuine user and rejects other users. Biometric performance
        requirements include the match rate, which reflects the accuracy of the biometric
        matching algorithm used by a system.

      annotation: For systems where static passwords are employed, it is often a challenge

        is that adversaries can target the collection of passwords generated by the
        password manager. Therefore, the collection of passwords requires protection
        including encrypting the passwords (see IA-5(1)(d)) and storing the collection
        offline in a token.

        of PVI-I Credentials
      description: 'Accept and verify federated or PKI credentials that meet [Assignment:
        organization-defined policy].'
      annotation: Acceptance of PIV-I credentials can be implemented by PIV, PIV-I,
        and other commercial or external identity providers. The acceptance and verification
        of PIV-I-compliant credentials apply to both logical and physical access control
        systems. The acceptance and verification of PIV-I credentials address nonfederal
        issuers of identity cards that desire to interoperate with United States Government
        PIV systems and that can be trusted by Federal Government-relying parties.
        The X.509 certificate policy for the Federal Bridge Certification Authority
        (FBCA) addresses PIV-I requirements. The PIV-I card is commensurate with the
        PIV credentials as defined in cited references. PIV-I credentials are the
        credentials issued by a PIV-I provider whose PIV-I certificate policy maps
        to the Federal Bridge PIV-I Certificate Policy. A PIV-I provider is cross-certified
        with the FBCA (directly or through another PKI bridge) with policies that
        have been mapped and approved as meeting the requirements of the PIV-I policies
        defined in the FBCA certificate policy.

        tables or cryptographic techniques to blind credential service providers and
        relying parties from each other or to make identity attributes less visible
        to transmitting parties can reduce these privacy risks.

      annotation: Services that may require identification and authentication include
        web applications using digital certificates or services or applications that
        query a database. Identification and authentication methods for system services
        and applications include information or code signing, provenance graphs, and

        the validity of identification and authentication claims can be made by services
        separate from the services acting on those decisions. This can occur in distributed
        system architectures. In such situations, the identification and authentication
        decisions (instead of actual identifiers and authentication data) are provided
        to the services that need to act on those decisions.

      annotation: Adversaries may compromise individual authentication mechanisms
        employed by organizations and subsequently attempt to impersonate legitimate
        users. To address this threat, organizations may employ specific techniques
        or mechanisms and establish protocols to assess suspicious behavior. Suspicious
        behavior may include accessing information that individuals do not typically
        access as part of their duties, roles, or responsibilities; accessing greater
        quantities of information than individuals would routinely access; or attempting
        to access information from suspicious network addresses. When pre-established
        conditions or triggers occur, organizations can require individuals to provide
        additional authentication information. Another potential use for adaptive
        authentication is to increase the strength of mechanism based on the number
        or types of records being accessed. Adaptive authentication does not replace
        and is not used to avoid the use of multi-factor authentication mechanisms
        but can augment implementations of multi-factor authentication.

      annotation: To make it more difficult for adversaries to pose as legitimate
        users during the identity proofing process, organizations can use out-of-band
        methods to ensure that the individual associated with an address of record
        is the same individual that participated in the registration. Confirmation
        can take the form of a temporary enrollment code or a notice of proofing.
        The delivery address for these artifacts is obtained from records and not
        self-asserted by the user. The address can include a physical or digital address.
        A home address is an example of a physical address. Email addresses and telephone

      annotation: Incident response policy and procedures address the controls in

        management strategy is an important factor in establishing such policies and
        procedures. Policies and procedures contribute to security and privacy assurance.
        Therefore, it is important that security and privacy programs collaborate
        on the development of incident response policy and procedures. Security and
        privacy program policies and procedures at the organization level are preferable,
        in general, and may obviate the need for mission- or system-specific policies
        and procedures. The policy can be included as part of the general security
        and privacy policy or be represented by multiple policies that reflect the
        complex nature of organizations. Procedures can be established for security
        and privacy programs, for mission or business processes, and for systems,
        if needed. Procedures describe how the policies or controls are implemented
        and can be directed at the individual or role that is the object of the procedure.
        Procedures can be documented in system security and privacy plans or in one
        or more separate documents. Events that may precipitate an update to incident
        response policy and procedures include assessment or audit findings, security
        incidents or breaches, or changes in laws, executive orders, directives, regulations,
        policies, standards, and guidelines. Simply restating controls does not constitute
        an organizational policy or procedure.

      description: 'a. Implement an incident handling capability for incidents that
        is consistent with the incident response plan and includes preparation, detection
        and analysis, containment, eradication, and recovery;

        b. Coordinate incident handling activities with contingency planning activities;

        changes accordingly; and

        d. Ensure the rigor, intensity, scope, and results of incident handling activities
        are comparable and predictable across the organization.'
      annotation: Organizations recognize that incident response capabilities are
        dependent on the capabilities of organizational systems and the mission and
        business processes being supported by those systems. Organizations consider
        incident response as part of the definition, design, and development of mission
        and business processes and systems. Incident-related information can be obtained
        from a variety of sources, including audit monitoring, physical access monitoring,
        and network monitoring; user or administrator reports; and reported supply
        chain events. An effective incident handling capability includes coordination
        among many organizational entities (e.g., mission or business owners, system
        owners, authorizing officials, human resources offices, physical security
        offices, personnel security offices, legal departments, risk executive [function],
        operations personnel, procurement offices). Suspected security incidents include
        the receipt of suspicious email communications that can contain malicious
        code. Suspected supply chain incidents include the insertion of counterfeit
        hardware or malicious code into organizational systems or system components.
        For federal agencies, an incident that involves personally identifiable information
        is considered a breach. A breach results in unauthorized disclosure, the loss
        of control, unauthorized acquisition, compromise, or a similar occurrence
        where a person other than an authorized user accesses or potentially accesses
        personally identifiable information or an authorized user accesses or potentially
        accesses such information for other than authorized purposes.

        of systems to stop attacks, misdirect attackers, and isolate components of
        systems, thus limiting the extent of the damage from breaches or compromises.
        Organizations include specific time frames for achieving the reconfiguration
        of systems in the definition of the reconfiguration capability, considering
        the potential need for rapid response to effectively address cyber threats.

      annotation: 'An integrated incident response team is a team of experts that
        assesses, documents, and responds to incidents so that organizational systems
        and networks can recover quickly and implement the necessary controls to avoid
        future incidents. Incident response team personnel include forensic and malicious
        code analysts, tool developers, systems security and privacy engineers, and
        real-time operations personnel. The incident handling capability includes
        performing rapid forensic preservation of evidence and analysis of and response
        to intrusions. For some organizations, the incident response team can be a
        cross-organizational entity.

        An integrated incident response team facilitates information sharing and allows
        organizational personnel (e.g., developers, implementers, and operators) to
        leverage team knowledge of the threat and implement defensive measures that
        enable organizations to deter intrusions more effectively. Moreover, integrated
        teams promote the rapid detection of intrusions, the development of appropriate
        mitigations, and the deployment of effective defensive measures. For example,
        when an intrusion is detected, the integrated team can rapidly develop an
        appropriate response for operators to implement, correlate the new incident
        with information on past intrusions, and augment ongoing cyber intelligence
        development. Integrated incident response teams are better able to identify
        adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures that are linked to the operations
        tempo or specific mission and business functions and to define responsive
        actions in a way that does not disrupt those mission and business functions.
        Incident response teams can be distributed within organizations to make the

      annotation: Information spillage refers to instances where information is placed
        on systems that are not authorized to process such information. Information
        spills occur when information that is thought to be a certain classification
        or impact level is transmitted to a system and subsequently is determined
        to be of a higher classification or impact level. At that point, corrective
        action is required. The nature of the response is based on the classification
        or impact level of the spilled information, the security capabilities of the
        system, the specific nature of the contaminated storage media, and the access
        authorizations of individuals with authorized access to the contaminated system.
        The methods used to communicate information about the spill after the fact
        do not involve methods directly associated with the actual spill to minimize

      annotation: Maintenance policy and procedures address the controls in the MA
        family that are implemented within systems and organizations. The risk management
        strategy is an important factor in establishing such policies and procedures.
        Policies and procedures contribute to security and privacy assurance. Therefore,
        it is important that security and privacy programs collaborate on the development
        of maintenance policy and procedures. Security and privacy program policies
        and procedures at the organization level are preferable, in general, and may
        obviate the need for mission- or system-specific policies and procedures.
        The policy can be included as part of the general security and privacy policy
        or be represented by multiple policies that reflect the complex nature of
        organizations. Procedures can be established for security and privacy programs,
        for mission or business processes, and for systems, if needed. Procedures
        describe how the policies or controls are implemented and can be directed
        at the individual or role that is the object of the procedure. Procedures
        can be documented in system security and privacy plans or in one or more separate
        documents. Events that may precipitate an update to maintenance policy and
        procedures assessment or audit findings, security incidents or breaches, or
        changes in applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies,
        standards, and guidelines. Simply restating controls does not constitute an
        organizational policy or procedure.

        maintenance and diagnostic sessions reflect the network access requirements
        in IA-2. Strong authentication requires authenticators that are resistant
        to replay attacks and employ multi-factor authentication. Strong authenticators
        include PKI where certificates are stored on a token protected by a password,
        passphrase, or biometric. Enforcing requirements in MA-4 is accomplished,
        in part, by other controls. SP 800-63B provides additional guidance on strong
        authentication and authenticators.

      annotation: Preventive maintenance includes proactive care and the servicing
        of system components to maintain organizational equipment and facilities in
        satisfactory operating condition. Such maintenance provides for the systematic
        inspection, tests, measurements, adjustments, parts replacement, detection,
        and correction of incipient failures either before they occur or before they
        develop into major defects. The primary goal of preventive maintenance is
        to avoid or mitigate the consequences of equipment failures. Preventive maintenance
        is designed to preserve and restore equipment reliability by replacing worn
        components before they fail. Methods of determining what preventive (or other)
        failure management policies to apply include original equipment manufacturer
        recommendations; statistical failure records; expert opinion; maintenance
        that has already been conducted on similar equipment; requirements of codes,
        laws, or regulations within a jurisdiction; or measured values and performance
        indications.

      annotation: Predictive maintenance evaluates the condition of equipment by performing
        periodic or continuous (online) equipment condition monitoring. The goal of
        predictive maintenance is to perform maintenance at a scheduled time when
        the maintenance activity is most cost-effective and before the equipment loses
        performance within a threshold. The predictive component of predictive maintenance
        stems from the objective of predicting the future trend of the equipment's
        condition. The predictive maintenance approach employs principles of statistical
        process control to determine at what point in the future maintenance activities
        will be appropriate. Most predictive maintenance inspections are performed
        while equipment is in service, thus minimizing disruption of normal system
        operations. Predictive maintenance can result in substantial cost savings
        and higher system reliability.

        critical systems designated as such by the organization, it may be necessary
        to restrict or prohibit field maintenance at the local site and require that
        such maintenance be conducted in trusted facilities with additional controls.

        management strategy is an important factor in establishing such policies and
        procedures. Policies and procedures contribute to security and privacy assurance.
        Therefore, it is important that security and privacy programs collaborate
        on the development of media protection policy and procedures. Security and
        privacy program policies and procedures at the organization level are preferable,
        in general, and may obviate the need for mission- or system-specific policies
        and procedures. The policy can be included as part of the general security
        and privacy policy or be represented by multiple policies that reflect the
        complex nature of organizations. Procedures can be established for security
        and privacy programs, for mission or business processes, and for systems,
        if needed. Procedures describe how the policies or controls are implemented
        and can be directed at the individual or role that is the object of the procedure.
        Procedures can be documented in system security and privacy plans or in one
        or more separate documents. Events that may precipitate an update to media
        protection policy and procedures include assessment or audit findings, security
        incidents or breaches, or changes in applicable laws, executive orders, directives,
        regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines. Simply restating controls
        does not constitute an organizational policy or procedure.

        discs. Non-digital media includes paper and microfilm. Physically controlling
        stored media includes conducting inventories, ensuring procedures are in place
        to allow individuals to check out and return media to the library, and maintaining
        accountability for stored media. Secure storage includes a locked drawer,
        desk, or cabinet or a controlled media library. The type of media storage
        is commensurate with the security category or classification of the information
        on the media. Controlled areas are spaces that provide physical and procedural

        determined to be in the public domain, publicly releasable, or have limited
        adverse impacts on organizations, operations, or individuals if accessed by
        other than authorized personnel. In these situations, physical access controls
        provide adequate protection.

        areas are spaces for which organizations provide physical or procedural controls
        to meet requirements established for protecting information and systems. Controls
        to protect media during transport include cryptography and locked containers.
        Cryptographic mechanisms can provide confidentiality and integrity protections
        depending on the mechanisms implemented. Activities associated with media
        transport include releasing media for transport, ensuring that media enters
        the appropriate transport processes, and the actual transport. Authorized
        transport and courier personnel may include individuals external to the organization.
        Maintaining accountability of media during transport includes restricting
        transport activities to authorized personnel and tracking and/or obtaining
        records of transport activities as the media moves through the transportation
        system to prevent and detect loss, destruction, or tampering. Organizations
        establish documentation requirements for activities associated with the transport
        of system media in accordance with organizational assessments of risk. Organizations
        maintain the flexibility to define record-keeping methods for the different
        types of media transport as part of a system of transport-related records.

      annotation: Organizations employ dual authorization to help ensure that system
        media sanitization cannot occur unless two technically qualified individuals
        conduct the designated task. Individuals who sanitize system media possess
        sufficient skills and expertise to determine if the proposed sanitization
        reflects applicable federal and organizational standards, policies, and procedures.
        Dual authorization also helps to ensure that sanitization occurs as intended,
        protecting against errors and false claims of having performed the sanitization
        actions. Dual authorization may also be known as two-person control. To reduce
        the risk of collusion, organizations consider rotating dual authorization
        duties to other individuals.

        b. Prohibit the use of portable storage devices in organizational systems
        when such devices have no identifiable owner.'
      annotation: System media includes both digital and non-digital media. Digital
        media includes diskettes, magnetic tapes, flash drives, compact discs, digital
        versatile discs, and removable hard disk drives. Non-digital media includes
        paper and microfilm. Media use protections also apply to mobile devices with
        information storage capabilities. In contrast to MP-2, which restricts user
        access to media, MP-7 restricts the use of certain types of media on systems,
        for example, restricting or prohibiting the use of flash drives or external
        hard disk drives. Organizations use technical and nontechnical controls to
        restrict the use of system media. Organizations may restrict the use of portable
        storage devices, for example, by using physical cages on workstations to prohibit
        access to certain external ports or disabling or removing the ability to insert,
        read, or write to such devices. Organizations may also limit the use of portable
        storage devices to only approved devices, including devices provided by the
        organization, devices provided by other approved organizations, and devices
        that are not personally owned. Finally, organizations may restrict the use
        of portable storage devices based on the type of device, such as by prohibiting
        the use of writeable, portable storage devices and implementing this restriction
        by disabling or removing the capability to write to such devices. Requiring
        identifiable owners for storage devices reduces the risk of using such devices
        by allowing organizations to assign responsibility for addressing known vulnerabilities
        in the devices.

        from the media, typically by security category or classification level, such
        that the information cannot be retrieved or reconstructed. Downgrading of
        media includes redacting information to enable wider release and distribution.
        Downgrading ensures that empty space on the media is devoid of information.

      annotation: Physical and environmental protection policy and procedures address
        the controls in the PE family that are implemented within systems and organizations.
        The risk management strategy is an important factor in establishing such policies
        and procedures. Policies and procedures contribute to security and privacy
        assurance. Therefore, it is important that security and privacy programs collaborate
        on the development of physical and environmental protection policy and procedures.
        Security and privacy program policies and procedures at the organization level
        are preferable, in general, and may obviate the need for mission- or system-specific
        policies and procedures. The policy can be included as part of the general
        security and privacy policy or be represented by multiple policies that reflect
        the complex nature of organizations. Procedures can be established for security
        and privacy programs, for mission or business processes, and for systems,
        if needed. Procedures describe how the policies or controls are implemented
        and can be directed at the individual or role that is the object of the procedure.
        Procedures can be documented in system security and privacy plans or in one
        or more separate documents. Events that may precipitate an update to physical
        and environmental protection policy and procedures include assessment or audit
        findings, security incidents or breaches, or changes in applicable laws, executive
        orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines. Simply
        restating controls does not constitute an organizational policy or procedure.

        the facility. Interlocking door controllers can be used to limit the number
        of individuals who enter controlled access points and to provide containment
        areas while authorization for physical access is verified. Interlocking door
        controllers can be fully automated (i.e., controlling the opening and closing
        of the doors) or partially automated (i.e., using security guards to control
        the number of individuals entering the containment area).

        to long-term alternate power] in the event of a primary power source loss.'
      annotation: An uninterruptible power supply (UPS) is an electrical system or
        mechanism that provides emergency power when there is a failure of the main
        power source. A UPS is typically used to protect computers, data centers,
        telecommunication equipment, or other electrical equipment where an unexpected
        power disruption could cause injuries, fatalities, serious mission or business
        disruption, or loss of data or information. A UPS differs from an emergency
        power system or backup generator in that the UPS provides near-instantaneous
        protection from unanticipated power interruptions from the main power source
        by providing energy stored in batteries, supercapacitors, or flywheels. The
        battery duration of a UPS is relatively short but provides sufficient time
        to start a standby power source, such as a backup generator, or properly shut
        down the system.

        controlling output to the output devices are addressed in AC-3 or AC-4. Components
        are marked to indicate the impact level or classification level of the system
        to which the devices are connected, or the impact level or classification
        level of the information permitted to be output. Security marking refers to
        the use of human-readable security attributes. Security labeling refers to
        the use of security attributes for internal system data structures. Security
        marking is generally not required for hardware components that process, store,

        is important that security and privacy programs collaborate on their development.
        Security and privacy program policies and procedures at the organization level
        are preferable, in general, and may obviate the need for mission level or
        system-specific policies and procedures. The policy can be included as part
        of the general security and privacy policy or be represented by multiple policies
        that reflect the complex nature of organizations. Procedures can be established
        for security and privacy programs, for mission/business processes, and for
        systems, if needed. Procedures describe how the policies or controls are implemented
        and can be directed at the individual or role that is the object of the procedure.
        Procedures can be documented in system security and privacy plans or in one
        or more separate documents. Events that may precipitate an update to planning
        policy and procedures include, but are not limited to, assessment or audit
        findings, security incidents or breaches, or changes in laws, executive orders,
        directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines. Simply restating
        controls does not constitute an organizational policy or procedure.

        \ during capability determination, analysis of alternatives, requests for\
        \ proposal, and design reviews). Section 2.1 describes the different types\

        \ information in other established management and operational areas, including\
        \ enterprise architecture, system development life cycle, systems engineering,\

        Organizations consider rules of behavior based on individual user roles and
        responsibilities and differentiate between rules that apply to privileged
        users and rules that apply to general users. Establishing rules of behavior
        for some types of non-organizational users, including individuals who receive

        (b) Ensures that the allocated controls operate in a coordinated and mutually
        reinforcing manner.'
      annotation: Organizations strategically allocate security and privacy controls
        in the security and privacy architectures so that adversaries must overcome
        multiple controls to achieve their objective. Requiring adversaries to defeat
        multiple controls makes it more difficult to attack information resources
        by increasing the work factor of the adversary; it also increases the likelihood
        of detection. The coordination of allocated controls is essential to ensure
        that an attack that involves one control does not create adverse, unintended
        consequences by interfering with other controls. Unintended consequences can
        include system lockout and cascading alarms. The placement of controls in
        systems and organizations is an important activity that requires thoughtful
        analysis. The value of organizational assets is an important consideration
        in providing additional layering. Defense-in-depth architectural approaches
        include modularity and layering (see SA-8(3)), separation of system and user
        functionality (see SC-2), and security function isolation (see SC-3).

      annotation: Information technology products have different strengths and weaknesses.
        Providing a broad spectrum of products complements the individual offerings.
        For example, vendors offering malicious code protection typically update their
        products at different times, often developing solutions for known viruses,
        Trojans, or worms based on their priorities and development schedules. By
        deploying different products at different locations, there is an increased
        likelihood that at least one of the products will detect the malicious code.
        With respect to privacy, vendors may offer products that track personally
        identifiable information in systems. Products may use different tracking methods.
        Using multiple products may result in more assurance that personally identifiable
        information is inventoried.

      annotation: 'Central management refers to organization-wide management and implementation
        of selected controls and processes. This includes planning, implementing,
        assessing, authorizing, and monitoring the organization-defined, centrally
        managed controls and processes. As the central management of controls is generally
        associated with the concept of common (inherited) controls, such management
        promotes and facilitates standardization of control implementations and management
        and the judicious use of organizational resources. Centrally managed controls
        and processes may also meet independence requirements for assessments in support
        of initial and ongoing authorizations to operate and as part of organizational
        continuous monitoring.

        Automated tools (e.g., security information and event management tools or
        enterprise security monitoring and management tools) can improve the accuracy,
        consistency, and availability of information associated with centrally managed
        controls and processes. Automation can also provide data aggregation and data
        correlation capabilities; alerting mechanisms; and dashboards to support risk-based
        decision-making within the organization.

        As part of the control selection processes, organizations determine the controls
        that may be suitable for central management based on resources and capabilities.
        It is not always possible to centrally manage every aspect of a control. In
        such cases, the control can be treated as a hybrid control with the control
        managed and implemented centrally or at the system level. The controls and

      annotation: The concept of tailoring allows organizations to specialize or customize
        a set of baseline controls by applying a defined set of tailoring actions.
        Tailoring actions facilitate such specialization and customization by allowing
        organizations to develop security and privacy plans that reflect their specific
        mission and business functions, the environments where their systems operate,
        the threats and vulnerabilities that can affect their systems, and any other
        conditions or situations that can impact their mission or business success.
        Tailoring guidance is provided in SP 800-53B. Tailoring a control baseline
        is accomplished by identifying and designating common controls, applying scoping
        considerations, selecting compensating controls, assigning values to control
        parameters, supplementing the control baseline with additional controls as
        needed, and providing information for control implementation. The general
        tailoring actions in SP 800-53B can be supplemented with additional actions
        based on the needs of organizations. Tailoring actions can be applied to the
        baselines in SP 800-53B in accordance with the security and privacy requirements
        from FISMA, PRIVACT, and OMB A-130. Alternatively, other communities of interest
        adopting different control baselines can apply the tailoring actions in SP
        800-53B to specialize or customize the controls that represent the specific
        needs and concerns of those entities.

      annotation: Protection needs are technology-independent capabilities that are
        required to counter threats to organizations, individuals, systems, and the
        Nation through the compromise of information (i.e., loss of confidentiality,
        integrity, availability, or privacy). Information protection and personally
        identifiable information processing needs are derived from the mission and
        business needs defined by organizational stakeholders, the mission and business
        processes designed to meet those needs, and the organizational risk management
        strategy. Information protection and personally identifiable information processing
        needs determine the required controls for the organization and the systems.
        Inherent to defining protection and personally identifiable information processing
        needs is an understanding of the adverse impact that could result if a compromise
        or breach of information occurs. The categorization process is used to make
        such potential impact determinations. Privacy risks to individuals can arise
        from the compromise of personally identifiable information, but they can also
        arise as unintended consequences or a byproduct of the processing of personally
        identifiable information at any stage of the information life cycle. Privacy
        risk assessments are used to prioritize the risks that are created for individuals
        from system processing of personally identifiable information. These risk
        assessments enable the selection of the required privacy controls for the
        organization and systems. Mission and business process definitions and the
        associated protection requirements are documented in accordance with organizational
        policies and procedures.

      name: Insider Threat Program
      description: Implement an insider threat program that includes a cross-discipline
        insider threat incident handling team.
      annotation: 'Organizations that handle classified information are required,
        under Executive Order 13587 EO 13587 and the National Insider Threat Policy
        ODNI NITP, to establish insider threat programs. The same standards and guidelines
        that apply to insider threat programs in classified environments can also
        be employed effectively to improve the security of controlled unclassified
        and other information in non-national security systems. Insider threat programs
        include controls to detect and prevent malicious insider activity through
        the centralized integration and analysis of both technical and nontechnical
        information to identify potential insider threat concerns. A senior official
        is designated by the department or agency head as the responsible individual
        to implement and provide oversight for the program. In addition to the centralized
        integration and analysis capability, insider threat programs require organizations
        to prepare department or agency insider threat policies and implementation
        plans, conduct host-based user monitoring of individual employee activities
        on government-owned classified computers, provide insider threat awareness
        training to employees, receive access to information from offices in the department
        or agency for insider threat analysis, and conduct self-assessments of department
        or agency insider threat posture.

        Insider threat programs can leverage the existence of incident handling teams
        that organizations may already have in place, such as computer security incident
        response teams. Human resources records are especially important in this effort,
        as there is compelling evidence to show that some types of insider crimes
        are often preceded by nontechnical behaviors in the workplace, including ongoing
        patterns of disgruntled behavior and conflicts with coworkers and other colleagues.
        These precursors can guide organizational officials in more focused, targeted
        monitoring efforts. However, the use of human resource records could raise
        significant concerns for privacy. The participation of a legal team, including
        consultation with the senior agency official for privacy, ensures that monitoring
        activities are performed in accordance with applicable laws, executive orders,
        directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines.'

        of adversaries, especially the advanced persistent threat (APT), it may be
        more likely that adversaries can successfully breach or compromise organizational

        and procedures) that organizations have experienced, mitigations that organizations
        have found are effective against certain types of threats, and threat intelligence
        (i.e., indications and warnings about threats). Threat information sharing
        may be bilateral or multilateral. Bilateral threat sharing includes government-to-commercial
        and government-to-government cooperatives. Multilateral threat sharing includes
        organizations taking part in threat-sharing consortia. Threat information

        For federal agencies, keeping an accounting of disclosures is required by

        privacy and legal counsel on this requirement and be aware of the statutory
        exceptions and OMB guidance relating to the provision.

        Organizations can use any system for keeping notations of disclosures, if
        it can construct from such a system, a document listing of all disclosures
        along with the required information. Automated mechanisms can be used by organizations
        to determine when personally identifiable information is disclosed, including
        commercial services that provide notifications and alerts. Accounting of disclosures

        awareness of the security and privacy posture across the organization to support
        organizational risk management decisions. The terms continuous and ongoing
        imply that organizations assess and monitor their controls and risks at a
        frequency sufficient to support risk-based decisions. Different types of controls
        may require different monitoring frequencies. The results of continuous monitoring
        guide and inform risk response actions by organizations. Continuous monitoring
        programs allow organizations to maintain the authorizations of systems and
        common controls in highly dynamic environments of operation with changing
        mission and business needs, threats, vulnerabilities, and technologies. Having
        access to security- and privacy-related information on a continuing basis
        through reports and dashboards gives organizational officials the capability
        to make effective, timely, and informed risk management decisions, including
        ongoing authorization decisions. To further facilitate security and privacy
        risk management, organizations consider aligning organization-defined monitoring
        metrics with organizational risk tolerance as defined in the risk management
        strategy. Monitoring requirements, including the need for monitoring, may

        b. Establish screening criteria for individuals filling those positions; and

        c. Review and update position risk designations [Assignment: organization-defined

      annotation: Position risk designations reflect Office of Personnel Management
        (OPM) policy and guidance. Proper position designation is the foundation of
        an effective and consistent suitability and personnel security program. The
        Position Designation System (PDS) assesses the duties and responsibilities
        of a position to determine the degree of potential damage to the efficiency
        or integrity of the service due to misconduct of an incumbent of a position
        and establishes the risk level of that position. The PDS assessment also determines
        if the duties and responsibilities of the position present the potential for
        position incumbents to bring about a material adverse effect on national security
        and the degree of that potential effect, which establishes the sensitivity
        level of a position. The results of the assessment determine what level of
        investigation is conducted for a position. Risk designations can guide and
        inform the types of authorizations that individuals receive when accessing
        organizational information and information systems. Position screening criteria
        include explicit information security role appointment requirements. Parts
        1400 and 731 of Title 5, Code of Federal Regulations, establish the requirements
        for organizations to evaluate relevant covered positions for a position sensitivity
        and position risk designation commensurate with the duties and responsibilities
        of those positions.

      annotation: Personally identifiable information processing and transparency
        policy and procedures address the controls in the PT family that are implemented

        factor in establishing such policies and procedures. Policies and procedures
        contribute to security and privacy assurance. Therefore, it is important that
        security and privacy programs collaborate on the development of personally
        identifiable information processing and transparency policy and procedures.
        Security and privacy program policies and procedures at the organization level
        are preferable, in general, and may obviate the need for mission- or system-specific
        policies and procedures. The policy can be included as part of the general
        security and privacy policy or be represented by multiple policies that reflect
        the complex nature of organizations. Procedures can be established for security
        and privacy programs, for mission or business processes, and for systems,
        if needed. Procedures describe how the policies or controls are implemented
        and can be directed at the individual or role that is the object of the procedure.
        Procedures can be documented in system security and privacy plans or in one
        or more separate documents. Events that may precipitate an update to personally
        identifiable information processing and transparency policy and procedures
        include assessment or audit findings, breaches, or changes in applicable laws,
        executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines.
        Simply restating controls does not constitute an organizational policy or
        procedure.

        to an individual. Consent may be required by applicable laws, executive orders,
        directives, regulations, policies, standards, or guidelines. Otherwise, when
        selecting consent as a control, organizations consider whether individuals
        can be reasonably expected to understand and accept the privacy risks that
        arise from their authorization. Organizations consider whether other controls
        may more effectively mitigate privacy risk either alone or in conjunction
        with consent. Organizations also consider any demographic or contextual factors
        that may influence the understanding or behavior of individuals with respect
        to the processing carried out by the system or organization. When soliciting
        consent from individuals, organizations consider the appropriate mechanism
        for obtaining consent, including the type of consent (e.g., opt-in, opt-out),
        how to properly authenticate and identity proof individuals and how to obtain
        consent through electronic means. In addition, organizations consider providing
        a mechanism for individuals to revoke consent once it has been provided, as
        appropriate. Finally, organizations consider usability factors to help individuals
        understand the risks being accepted when providing consent, including the
        use of plain language and avoiding technical jargon.

        was originally collected. The PRIVACT requires agencies to describe each routine
        use of the records maintained in the system of records, including the categories
        of users of the records and the purpose of the use. Agencies may only establish
        routine uses by explicitly publishing them in the relevant system of records

      annotation: The PRIVACT establishes requirements for federal and non-federal
        agencies if they engage in a matching program. In general, a matching program
        is a computerized comparison of records from two or more automated PRIVACT
        systems of records or an automated system of records and automated records
        maintained by a non-federal agency (or agent thereof). A matching program
        either pertains to federal benefit programs or federal personnel or payroll
        records. A federal benefit match is performed to determine or verify eligibility
        for payments under federal benefit programs or to recoup payments or delinquent
        debts under federal benefit programs. A matching program involves not just
        the matching activity itself but also the investigative follow-up and ultimate
        action, if any.

      annotation: Risk assessment policy and procedures address the controls in the
        RA family that are implemented within systems and organizations. The risk
        management strategy is an important factor in establishing such policies and
        procedures. Policies and procedures contribute to security and privacy assurance.
        Therefore, it is important that security and privacy programs collaborate
        on the development of risk assessment policy and procedures. Security and
        privacy program policies and procedures at the organization level are preferable,
        in general, and may obviate the need for mission- or system-specific policies
        and procedures. The policy can be included as part of the general security
        and privacy policy or be represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex
        nature of organizations. Procedures can be established for security and privacy
        programs, for mission or business processes, and for systems, if needed. Procedures
        describe how the policies or controls are implemented and can be directed
        at the individual or role that is the object of the procedure. Procedures
        can be documented in system security and privacy plans or in one or more separate
        documents. Events that may precipitate an update to risk assessment policy
        and procedures include assessment or audit findings, security incidents or
        breaches, or changes in laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies,
        standards, and guidelines. Simply restating controls does not constitute an
        organizational policy or procedure.

        a type of asset loss characterization in systems security engineering processes

        can use privacy risk assessments or privacy impact assessments to better understand
        the potential adverse effects on individuals. CNSSI 1253 provides additional
        guidance on categorization for national security systems.

        Organizations conduct the security categorization process as an organization-wide

        agency information security officers, senior agency officials for privacy,
        system owners, mission and business owners, and information owners or stewards.

        Security categorization processes facilitate the development of inventories
        of information assets and, along with CM-8, mappings to specific system components
        where information is processed, stored, or transmitted. The security categorization
        process is revisited throughout the system development life cycle to ensure

        low impact, moderate impact, or high impact. Organizations that desire additional
        granularity in the system impact designations for risk-based decision-making,
        can further partition the systems into sub-categories of the initial system
        categorization. For example, an impact-level prioritization on a moderate-impact
        system can produce three new sub-categories: low-moderate systems, moderate-moderate
        systems, and high-moderate systems. Impact-level prioritization and the resulting
        sub-categories of the system give organizations an opportunity to focus their
        investments related to security control selection and the tailoring of control
        baselines in responding to identified risks. Impact-level prioritization can
        also be used to determine those systems that may be of heightened interest
        or value to adversaries or represent a critical loss to the federal enterprise,
        sometimes described as high value assets. For such high value assets, organizations
        may be more focused on complexity, aggregation, and information exchanges.
        Systems with high value assets can be prioritized by partitioning high-impact
        systems into low-high systems, moderate-high systems, and high-high systems.
        Alternatively, organizations can apply the guidance in CNSSI 1253 for security
        objective-related categorization.'

      annotation: An attack vector is a path or means by which an adversary can gain
        access to a system in order to deliver malicious code or exfiltrate information.
        Organizations can use attack trees to show how hostile activities by adversaries
        interact and combine to produce adverse impacts or negative consequences to
        systems and organizations. Such information, together with correlated data
        from vulnerability scanning tools, can provide greater clarity regarding multi-vulnerability
        and multi-hop attack vectors. The correlation of vulnerability scanning information
        is especially important when organizations are transitioning from older technologies
        to newer technologies (e.g., transitioning from IPv4 to IPv6 network protocols).
        During such transitions, some system components may inadvertently be unmanaged
        and create opportunities for adversary exploitation.

        mitigating risk by implementing new controls or strengthening existing controls,
        accepting risk with appropriate justification or rationale, sharing or transferring
        risk, or avoiding risk. The risk tolerance of the organization influences
        risk response decisions and actions. Risk response addresses the need to determine
        an appropriate response to risk before generating a plan of action and milestones
        entry. For example, the response may be to accept risk or reject risk, or
        it may be possible to mitigate the risk immediately so that a plan of action
        and milestones entry is not needed. However, if the risk response is to mitigate
        the risk, and the mitigation cannot be completed immediately, a plan of action
        and milestones entry is generated.

      annotation: "Not all system components, functions, or services necessarily require\

        The risk management strategy is an important factor in establishing such policies
        and procedures. Policies and procedures contribute to security and privacy
        assurance. Therefore, it is important that security and privacy programs collaborate
        on the development of system and services acquisition policy and procedures.
        Security and privacy program policies and procedures at the organization level
        are preferable, in general, and may obviate the need for mission- or system-specific
        policies and procedures. The policy can be included as part of the general
        security and privacy policy or be represented by multiple policies that reflect
        the complex nature of organizations. Procedures can be established for security
        and privacy programs, for mission or business processes, and for systems,
        if needed. Procedures describe how the policies or controls are implemented
        and can be directed at the individual or role that is the object of the procedure.
        Procedures can be documented in system security and privacy plans or in one
        or more separate documents. Events that may precipitate an update to system
        and services acquisition policy and procedures include assessment or audit
        findings, security incidents or breaches, or changes in laws, executive orders,

      annotation: Technology refresh planning may encompass hardware, software, firmware,
        processes, personnel skill sets, suppliers, service providers, and facilities.
        The use of obsolete or nearing obsolete technology may increase the security
        and privacy risks associated with unsupported components, counterfeit or repurposed
        components, components unable to implement security or privacy requirements,
        slow or inoperable components, components from untrusted sources, inadvertent
        personnel error, or increased complexity. Technology refreshes typically occur
        during the operations and maintenance stage of the system development life
        cycle.

        information security, privacy, and supply chain risk management; and

        i. Acceptance criteria.'
      annotation: 'Security and privacy functional requirements are typically derived
        from the high-level security and privacy requirements described in SA-2. The
        derived requirements include security and privacy capabilities, functions,
        and mechanisms. Strength requirements associated with such capabilities, functions,
        and mechanisms include degree of correctness, completeness, resistance to
        tampering or bypass, and resistance to direct attack. Assurance requirements
        include development processes, procedures, and methodologies as well as the
        evidence from development and assessment activities that provide grounds for
        confidence that the required functionality is implemented and possesses the
        required strength of mechanism. SP 800-160-1 describes the process of requirements
        engineering as part of the system development life cycle.

        Controls can be viewed as descriptions of the safeguards and protection capabilities
        appropriate for achieving the particular security and privacy objectives of
        the organization and for reflecting the security and privacy requirements
        of stakeholders. Controls are selected and implemented in order to satisfy
        system requirements and include developer and organizational responsibilities.
        Controls can include technical, administrative, and physical aspects. In some
        cases, the selection and implementation of a control may necessitate additional
        specification by the organization in the form of derived requirements or instantiated
        control parameter values. The derived requirements and control parameter values
        may be necessary to provide the appropriate level of implementation detail
        for controls within the system development life cycle.

        Security and privacy documentation requirements address all stages of the
        system development life cycle. Documentation provides user and administrator
        guidance for the implementation and operation of controls. The level of detail
        required in such documentation is based on the security categorization or
        classification level of the system and the degree to which organizations depend
        on the capabilities, functions, or mechanisms to meet risk response expectations.
        Requirements can include mandated configuration settings that specify allowed
        functions, ports, protocols, and services. Acceptance criteria for systems,
        system components, and system services are defined in the same manner as the
        criteria for any organizational acquisition or procurement.'

        components, or system services based on mission and business requirements,
        requirements for resiliency and trustworthiness, and requirements for analysis

        within the system can contain one or more modules. The high-level design for
        the system is expressed in terms of subsystems and the interfaces between
        subsystems providing security-relevant functionality. The low-level design
        for the system is expressed in terms of modules and the interfaces between

      annotation: Following a system development life cycle that includes state-of-the-practice
        software development methods, systems engineering methods, systems security
        and privacy engineering methods, and quality control processes helps to reduce
        the number and severity of latent errors within systems, system components,

      description: Require the developer of the system, system component, or system

      annotation: The identification of functions, ports, protocols, and services
        early in the system development life cycle (e.g., during the initial requirements
        definition and design stages) allows organizations to influence the design
        of the system, system component, or system service. This early involvement
        in the system development life cycle helps organizations avoid or minimize
        the use of functions, ports, protocols, or services that pose unnecessarily
        high risks and understand the trade-offs involved in blocking specific ports,
        protocols, or services or requiring system service providers to do so. Early
        identification of functions, ports, protocols, and services avoids costly
        retrofitting of controls after the system, component, or system service has
        been implemented. SA-9 describes the requirements for external system services.
        Organizations identify which functions, ports, protocols, and services are
        provided from external sources.

        to determine the quality and completeness of the content provided. System
        documentation may be used to support the management of supply chain risk,
        incident response, and other functions. Personnel or roles that require documentation
        include system owners, system security officers, and system administrators.
        Attempts to obtain documentation include contacting manufacturers or suppliers
        and conducting web-based searches. The inability to obtain documentation may
        occur due to the age of the system or component or the lack of support from
        developers and contractors. When documentation cannot be obtained, organizations
        may need to recreate the documentation if it is essential to the implementation
        or operation of the controls. The protection provided for the documentation
        is commensurate with the security category or classification of the system.
        Documentation that addresses system vulnerabilities may require an increased
        level of protection. Secure operation of the system includes initially starting
        the system and resuming secure system operation after a lapse in system operation.

        in the specification, design, development, implementation, and modification
        of the system and system components: [Assignment: organization-defined systems
        security and privacy engineering principles].'
      annotation: 'Systems security and privacy engineering principles are closely
        related to and implemented throughout the system development life cycle (see
        SA-3). Organizations can apply systems security and privacy engineering principles
        to new systems under development or to systems undergoing upgrades. For existing
        systems, organizations apply systems security and privacy engineering principles
        to system upgrades and modifications to the extent feasible, given the current
        state of hardware, software, and firmware components within those systems.

        The application of systems security and privacy engineering principles helps
        organizations develop trustworthy, secure, and resilient systems and reduces
        the susceptibility to disruptions, hazards, threats, and the creation of privacy
        problems for individuals. Examples of system security engineering principles
        include: developing layered protections; establishing security and privacy
        policies, architecture, and controls as the foundation for design and development;
        incorporating security and privacy requirements into the system development
        life cycle; delineating physical and logical security boundaries; ensuring
        that developers are trained on how to build secure software; tailoring controls

      annotation: The principle of least common mechanism states that the amount of
        mechanism common to more than one user and depended on by all users is minimized
        POPEK74. Mechanism minimization implies that different components of a system
        refrain from using the same mechanism to access a system resource. Every shared
        mechanism (especially a mechanism involving shared variables) represents a
        potential information path between users and is designed with care to ensure
        that it does not unintentionally compromise security SALTZER75. Implementing
        the principle of least common mechanism helps to reduce the adverse consequences
        of sharing the system state among different programs. A single program that
        corrupts a shared state (including shared variables) has the potential to
        corrupt other programs that are dependent on the state. The principle of least
        common mechanism also supports the principle of simplicity of design and addresses
        the issue of covert storage channels LAMPSON73.

      description: 'Implement the security design principles of modularity and layering
        in [Assignment: organization-defined systems or system components].'
      annotation: The principles of modularity and layering are fundamental across
        system engineering disciplines. Modularity and layering derived from functional
        decomposition are effective in managing system complexity by making it possible
        to comprehend the structure of the system. Modular decomposition, or refinement
        in system design, is challenging and resists general statements of principle.
        Modularity serves to isolate functions and related data structures into well-defined
        logical units. Layering allows the relationships of these units to be better
        understood so that dependencies are clear and undesired complexity can be
        avoided. The security design principle of modularity extends functional modularity
        to include considerations based on trust, trustworthiness, privilege, and
        security policy. Security-informed modular decomposition includes the allocation
        of policies to systems in a network, separation of system applications into
        processes with distinct address spaces, allocation of system policies to layers,
        and separation of processes into subjects with distinct privileges based on
        hardware-supported privilege domains.

      description: 'Implement the security design principle of partially ordered dependencies
        in [Assignment: organization-defined systems or system components].'
      annotation: The principle of partially ordered dependencies states that the
        synchronization, calling, and other dependencies in the system are partially
        ordered. A fundamental concept in system design is layering, whereby the system
        is organized into well-defined, functionally related modules or components.
        The layers are linearly ordered with respect to inter-layer dependencies,
        such that higher layers are dependent on lower layers. While providing functionality
        to higher layers, some layers can be self-contained and not dependent on lower
        layers. While a partial ordering of all functions in a given system may not
        be possible, if circular dependencies are constrained to occur within layers,
        the inherent problems of circularity can be more easily managed. Partially
        ordered dependencies and system layering contribute significantly to the simplicity
        and coherency of the system design. Partially ordered dependencies also facilitate
        system testing and analysis.

      annotation: The principle of efficiently mediated access states that policy
        enforcement mechanisms utilize the least common mechanism available while
        satisfying stakeholder requirements within expressed constraints. The mediation
        of access to system resources (i.e., CPU, memory, devices, communication ports,
        services, infrastructure, data, and information) is often the predominant
        security function of secure systems. It also enables the realization of protections
        for the capability provided to stakeholders by the system. Mediation of resource
        access can result in performance bottlenecks if the system is not designed
        correctly. For example, by using hardware mechanisms, efficiently mediated
        access can be achieved. Once access to a low-level resource such as memory
        has been obtained, hardware protection mechanisms can ensure that out-of-bounds
        access does not occur.

      description: 'Implement the security design principle of minimized sharing in
        [Assignment: organization-defined systems or system components].'
      annotation: The principle of minimized sharing states that no computer resource
        is shared between system components (e.g., subjects, processes, functions)
        unless it is absolutely necessary to do so. Minimized sharing helps to simplify
        system design and implementation. In order to protect user-domain resources
        from arbitrary active entities, no resource is shared unless that sharing
        has been explicitly requested and granted. The need for resource sharing can
        be motivated by the design principle of least common mechanism in the case
        of internal entities or driven by stakeholder requirements. However, internal
        sharing is carefully designed to avoid performance and covert storage and
        timing channel problems. Sharing via common mechanism can increase the susceptibility
        of data and information to unauthorized access, disclosure, use, or modification
        and can adversely affect the inherent capability provided by the system. To
        minimize sharing induced by common mechanisms, such mechanisms can be designed
        to be reentrant or virtualized to preserve separation. Moreover, the use of
        global data to share information is carefully scrutinized. The lack of encapsulation
        may obfuscate relationships among the sharing entities.

      name: Security and Privacy Engineering Principles | Reduced Complexity
      description: 'Implement the security design principle of reduced complexity
        in [Assignment: organization-defined systems or system components].'
      annotation: The principle of reduced complexity states that the system design
        is as simple and small as possible. A small and simple design is more understandable,
        more analyzable, and less prone to error. The reduced complexity principle
        applies to any aspect of a system, but it has particular importance for security
        due to the various analyses performed to obtain evidence about the emergent
        security property of the system. For such analyses to be successful, a small
        and simple design is essential. Application of the principle of reduced complexity
        contributes to the ability of system developers to understand the correctness
        and completeness of system security functions. It also facilitates the identification
        of potential vulnerabilities. The corollary of reduced complexity states that
        the simplicity of the system is directly related to the number of vulnerabilities
        it will contain; that is, simpler systems contain fewer vulnerabilities. An
        benefit of reduced complexity is that it is easier to understand whether the
        intended security policy has been captured in the system design and that fewer
        vulnerabilities are likely to be introduced during engineering development.
        An additional benefit is that any such conclusion about correctness, completeness,
        and the existence of vulnerabilities can be reached with a higher degree of
        assurance in contrast to conclusions reached in situations where the system
        design is inherently more complex. Transitioning from older technologies to
        newer technologies (e.g., transitioning from IPv4 to IPv6) may require implementing
        the older and newer technologies simultaneously during the transition period.
        This may result in a temporary increase in system complexity during the transition.

      description: 'Implement the security design principle of trusted components

      annotation: 'The principle of trusted components states that a component is
        trustworthy to at least a level commensurate with the security dependencies
        it supports (i.e., how much it is trusted to perform its security functions
        by other components). This principle enables the composition of components
        such that trustworthiness is not inadvertently diminished and the trust is
        not consequently misplaced. Ultimately, this principle demands some metric
        by which the trust in a component and the trustworthiness of a component can
        be measured on the same abstract scale. The principle of trusted components
        is particularly relevant when considering systems and components in which
        there are complex chains of trust dependencies. A trust dependency is also
        referred to as a trust relationship and there may be chains of trust relationships.

        The principle of trusted components also applies to a compound component that
        consists of subcomponents (e.g., a subsystem), which may have varying levels
        of trustworthiness. The conservative assumption is that the trustworthiness
        of a compound component is that of its least trustworthy subcomponent. It
        may be possible to provide a security engineering rationale that the trustworthiness
        of a particular compound component is greater than the conservative assumption.
        However, any such rationale reflects logical reasoning based on a clear statement
        of the trustworthiness objectives as well as relevant and credible evidence.
        The trustworthiness of a compound component is not the same as increased application
        of defense-in-depth layering within the component or a replication of components.
        Defense-in-depth techniques do not increase the trustworthiness of the whole
        above that of the least trustworthy component.'

      name: Security and Privacy Engineering Principles | Hierarchical Trust
      description: 'Implement the security design principle of hierarchical trust
        in [Assignment: organization-defined systems or system components].'
      annotation: The principle of hierarchical trust for components builds on the
        principle of trusted components and states that the security dependencies
        in a system will form a partial ordering if they preserve the principle of
        trusted components. The partial ordering provides the basis for trustworthiness
        reasoning or an assurance case (assurance argument) when composing a secure
        system from heterogeneously trustworthy components. To analyze a system composed
        of heterogeneously trustworthy components for its trustworthiness, it is essential
        to eliminate circular dependencies with regard to the trustworthiness. If
        a more trustworthy component located in a lower layer of the system were to
        depend on a less trustworthy component in a higher layer, this would, in effect,
        put the components in the same less trustworthy equivalence class per the
        principle of trusted components. Trust relationships, or chains of trust,
        can have various manifestations. For example, the root certificate of a certificate
        hierarchy is the most trusted node in the hierarchy, whereas the leaves in
        the hierarchy may be the least trustworthy nodes. Another example occurs in
        a layered high-assurance system where the security kernel (including the hardware
        base), which is located at the lowest layer of the system, is the most trustworthy
        component. The principle of hierarchical trust, however, does not prohibit
        the use of overly trustworthy components. There may be cases in a system of
        low trustworthiness where it is reasonable to employ a highly trustworthy
        component rather than one that is less trustworthy (e.g., due to availability
        or other cost-benefit driver). For such a case, any dependency of the highly
        trustworthy component upon a less trustworthy component does not degrade the
        trustworthiness of the resulting low-trust system.

      annotation: The principle of hierarchical protection states that a component
        need not be protected from more trustworthy components. In the degenerate
        case of the most trusted component, it protects itself from all other components.
        For example, if an operating system kernel is deemed the most trustworthy
        component in a system, then it protects itself from all untrusted applications
        it supports, but the applications, conversely, do not need to protect themselves
        from the kernel. The trustworthiness of users is a consideration for applying
        the principle of hierarchical protection. A trusted system need not protect
        itself from an equally trustworthy user, reflecting use of untrusted systems
        in system high environments where users are highly trustworthy and where other
        protections are put in place to bound and protect the system high execution

        may require simultaneous action (e.g., the firing of a nuclear weapon requires
        two different authorized individuals to give the correct command within a
        small time window) or a sequence of operations where each successive action
        is enabled by some prior action, but no single individual is able to enable
        more than one action.

      description: 'Implement the security design principle of self-reliant trustworthiness
        in [Assignment: organization-defined systems or system components].'
      annotation: The principle of self-reliant trustworthiness states that systems
        minimize their reliance on other systems for their own trustworthiness. A
        system is trustworthy by default, and any connection to an external entity
        is used to supplement its function. If a system were required to maintain
        a connection with another external entity in order to maintain its trustworthiness,
        then that system would be vulnerable to malicious and non-malicious threats
        that could result in the loss or degradation of that connection. The benefit
        of the principle of self-reliant trustworthiness is that the isolation of
        a system will make it less vulnerable to attack. A corollary to this principle
        relates to the ability of the system (or system component) to operate in isolation
        and then resynchronize with other components when it is rejoined with them.

        composition in [Assignment: organization-defined systems or system components].'
      annotation: The principle of secure distributed composition states that the
        composition of distributed components that enforce the same system security
        policy result in a system that enforces that policy at least as well as the
        individual components do. Many of the design principles for secure systems
        deal with how components can or should interact. The need to create or enable
        a capability from the composition of distributed components can magnify the
        relevancy of these principles. In particular, the translation of security
        policy from a stand-alone to a distributed system or a system-of-systems can
        have unexpected or emergent results. Communication protocols and distributed
        data consistency mechanisms help to ensure consistent policy enforcement across
        a distributed system. To ensure a system-wide level of assurance of correct
        policy enforcement, the security architecture of a distributed composite system
        is thoroughly analyzed.

      annotation: The principle of trusted communication channels states that when
        composing a system where there is a potential threat to communications between
        components (i.e., the interconnections between components), each communication
        channel is trustworthy to a level commensurate with the security dependencies
        it supports (i.e., how much it is trusted by other components to perform its
        security functions). Trusted communication channels are achieved by a combination
        of restricting access to the communication channel (to ensure an acceptable
        match in the trustworthiness of the endpoints involved in the communication)
        and employing end-to-end protections for the data transmitted over the communication
        channel (to protect against interception and modification and to further increase
        the assurance of proper end-to-end communication).

      annotation: 'The principle of continuous protection states that components and
        data used to enforce the security policy have uninterrupted protection that
        is consistent with the security policy and the security architecture assumptions.
        No assurances that the system can provide the confidentiality, integrity,
        availability, and privacy protections for its design capability can be made
        if there are gaps in the protection. Any assurances about the ability to secure
        a delivered capability require that data and information are continuously
        protected. That is, there are no periods during which data and information
        are left unprotected while under control of the system (i.e., during the creation,
        storage, processing, or communication of the data and information, as well
        as during system initialization, execution, failure, interruption, and shutdown).
        Continuous protection requires adherence to the precepts of the reference
        monitor concept (i.e., every request is validated by the reference monitor;
        the reference monitor is able to protect itself from tampering; and sufficient
        assurance of the correctness and completeness of the mechanism can be ascertained
        from analysis and testing) and the principle of secure failure and recovery
        (i.e., preservation of a secure state during error, fault, failure, and successful
        attack; preservation of a secure state during recovery to normal, degraded,
        or alternative operational modes).

        Continuous protection also applies to systems designed to operate in varying
        configurations, including those that deliver full operational capability and
        degraded-mode configurations that deliver partial operational capability.
        The continuous protection principle requires that changes to the system security
        policies be traceable to the operational need that drives the configuration
        and be verifiable (i.e., it is possible to verify that the proposed changes
        will not put the system into an insecure state). Insufficient traceability
        and verification may lead to inconsistent states or protection discontinuities
        due to the complex or undecidable nature of the problem. The use of pre-verified
        configuration definitions that reflect the new security policy enables analysis
        to determine that a transition from old to new policies is essentially atomic
        and that any residual effects from the old policy are guaranteed to not conflict
        with the new policy. The ability to demonstrate continuous protection is rooted
        in the clear articulation of life cycle protection needs as stakeholder security
        requirements.'

      annotation: 'The principle of secure metadata management states that metadata
        are first class objects with respect to security policy when the policy requires
        either complete protection of information or that the security subsystem be
        self-protecting. The principle of secure metadata management is driven by
        the recognition that a system, subsystem, or component cannot achieve self-protection
        unless it protects the data it relies on for correct execution. Data is generally
        not interpreted by the system that stores it. It may have semantic value (i.e.,
        it comprises information) to users and programs that process the data. In
        contrast, metadata is information about data, such as a file name or the date
        when the file was created. Metadata is bound to the target data that it describes
        in a way that the system can interpret, but it need not be stored inside of
        or proximate to its target data. There may be metadata whose target is itself
        metadata (e.g., the classification level or impact level of a file name),
        including self-referential metadata.

        The apparent secondary nature of metadata can lead to neglect of its legitimate
        need for protection, resulting in a violation of the security policy that
        includes the exfiltration of information. A particular concern associated
        with insufficient protections for metadata is associated with multilevel secure
        (MLS) systems. MLS systems mediate access by a subject to an object based
        on relative sensitivity levels. It follows that all subjects and objects in
        the scope of control of the MLS system are either directly labeled or indirectly
        attributed with sensitivity levels. The corollary of labeled metadata for
        MLS systems states that objects containing metadata are labeled. As with protection
        needs assessments for data, attention is given to ensure that the confidentiality
        and integrity protections are individually assessed, specified, and allocated
        to metadata, as would be done for mission, business, and system data.'

      description: 'Implement the security design principle of self-analysis in [Assignment:

      annotation: The principle of self-analysis states that a system component is
        able to assess its internal state and functionality to a limited extent at
        various stages of execution, and that this self-analysis capability is commensurate
        with the level of trustworthiness invested in the system. At the system level,
        self-analysis can be achieved through hierarchical assessments of trustworthiness
        established in a bottom-up fashion. In this approach, the lower-level components
        check for data integrity and correct functionality (to a limited extent) of
        higher-level components. For example, trusted boot sequences involve a trusted
        lower-level component that attests to the trustworthiness of the next higher-level
        components so that a transitive chain of trust can be established. At the
        root, a component attests to itself, which usually involves an axiomatic or
        environmentally enforced assumption about its integrity. Results of the self-analyses
        can be used to guard against externally induced errors, internal malfunction,
        or transient errors. By following this principle, some simple malfunctions
        or errors can be detected without allowing the effects of the error or malfunction
        to propagate outside of the component. Further, the self-test can be used
        to attest to the configuration of the component, detecting any potential conflicts
        in configuration with respect to the expected configuration.

      annotation: The principle of accountability and traceability states that it
        is possible to trace security-relevant actions (i.e., subject-object interactions)
        to the entity on whose behalf the action is being taken. The principle of
        accountability and traceability requires a trustworthy infrastructure that
        can record details about actions that affect system security (e.g., an audit
        subsystem). To record the details about actions, the system is able to uniquely
        identify the entity on whose behalf the action is being carried out and also
        record the relevant sequence of actions that are carried out. The accountability
        policy also requires that audit trail itself be protected from unauthorized
        access and modification. The principle of least privilege assists in tracing
        the actions to particular entities, as it increases the granularity of accountability.
        Associating specific actions with system entities, and ultimately with users,
        and making the audit trail secure against unauthorized access and modifications
        provide non-repudiation because once an action is recorded, it is not possible
        to change the audit trail. Another important function that accountability
        and traceability serves is in the routine and forensic analysis of events
        associated with the violation of security policy. Analysis of audit logs may
        provide additional information that may be helpful in determining the path
        or component that allowed the violation of the security policy and the actions
        of individuals associated with the violation of the security policy.

      description: 'Implement the security design principle of secure defaults in
        [Assignment: organization-defined systems or system components].'
      annotation: 'The principle of secure defaults states that the default configuration
        of a system (including its constituent subsystems, components, and mechanisms)
        reflects a restrictive and conservative enforcement of security policy. The
        principle of secure defaults applies to the initial (i.e., default) configuration
        of a system as well as to the security engineering and design of access control
        and other security functions that follow a deny unless explicitly authorized
        strategy. The initial configuration aspect of this principle requires that
        any as shipped configuration of a system, subsystem, or system component does
        not aid in the violation of the security policy and can prevent the system
        from operating in the default configuration for those cases where the security
        policy itself requires configuration by the operational user.

        Restrictive defaults mean that the system will operate as-shipped with adequate
        self-protection and be able to prevent security breaches before the intended
        security policy and system configuration is established. In cases where the
        protection provided by the as-shipped product is inadequate, stakeholders
        assess the risk of using it prior to establishing a secure initial state.
        Adherence to the principle of secure defaults guarantees that a system is
        established in a secure state upon successfully completing initialization.
        In situations where the system fails to complete initialization, either it
        will perform a requested operation using secure defaults or it will not perform
        the operation. Refer to the principles of continuous protection and secure
        failure and recovery that parallel this principle to provide the ability to
        detect and recover from failure.

        The security engineering approach to this principle states that security mechanisms
        deny requests unless the request is found to be well-formed and consistent
        with the security policy. The insecure alternative is to allow a request unless
        it is shown to be inconsistent with the policy. In a large system, the conditions
        that are satisfied to grant a request that is denied by default are often
        far more compact and complete than those that would need to be checked in
        order to deny a request that is granted by default.'

      description: 'Implement the security design principle of secure failure and
        recovery in [Assignment: organization-defined systems or system components].'
      annotation: 'The principle of secure failure and recovery states that neither
        a failure in a system function or mechanism nor any recovery action in response
        to failure leads to a violation of security policy. The principle of secure
        failure and recovery parallels the principle of continuous protection to ensure
        that a system is capable of detecting (within limits) actual and impending
        failure at any stage of its operation (i.e., initialization, normal operation,
        shutdown, and maintenance) and to take appropriate steps to ensure that security
        policies are not violated. In addition, when specified, the system is capable
        of recovering from impending or actual failure to resume normal, degraded,
        or alternative secure operations while ensuring that a secure state is maintained
        such that security policies are not violated.

        Failure is a condition in which the behavior of a component deviates from
        its specified or expected behavior for an explicitly documented input. Once
        a failed security function is detected, the system may reconfigure itself
        to circumvent the failed component while maintaining security and provide
        all or part of the functionality of the original system, or it may completely
        shut itself down to prevent any further violation of security policies. For
        this to occur, the reconfiguration functions of the system are designed to
        ensure continuous enforcement of security policy during the various phases
        of reconfiguration.

        Another technique that can be used to recover from failures is to perform
        a rollback to a secure state (which may be the initial state) and then either
        shutdown or replace the service or component that failed such that secure
        operations may resume. Failure of a component may or may not be detectable
        to the components using it. The principle of secure failure indicates that
        components fail in a state that denies rather than grants access. For example,
        a nominally atomic operation interrupted before completion does not violate
        security policy and is designed to handle interruption events by employing
        higher-level atomicity and rollback mechanisms (e.g., transactions). If a
        service is being used, its atomicity properties are well-documented and characterized
        so that the component availing itself of that service can detect and handle
        interruption events appropriately. For example, a system is designed to gracefully
        respond to disconnection and support resynchronization and data consistency
        after disconnection.

        Failure protection strategies that employ replication of policy enforcement
        mechanisms, sometimes called defense in depth, can allow the system to continue
        in a secure state even when one mechanism has failed to protect the system.
        If the mechanisms are similar, however, the additional protection may be illusory,
        as the adversary can simply attack in series. Similarly, in a networked system,
        breaking the security on one system or service may enable an attacker to do
        the same on other similar replicated systems and services. By employing multiple
        protection mechanisms whose features are significantly different, the possibility
        of attack replication or repetition can be reduced. Analyses are conducted
        to weigh the costs and benefits of such redundancy techniques against increased
        resource usage and adverse effects on the overall system performance. Additional
        analyses are conducted as the complexity of these mechanisms increases, as
        could be the case for dynamic behaviors. Increased complexity generally reduces
        trustworthiness. When a resource cannot be continuously protected, it is critical
        to detect and repair any security breaches before the resource is once again
        used in a secure context.'

      annotation: 'The principle of performance security states that security mechanisms
        are constructed so that they do not degrade system performance unnecessarily.
        Stakeholder and system design requirements for performance and security are
        precisely articulated and prioritized. For the system implementation to meet
        its design requirements and be found acceptable to stakeholders (i.e., validation
        against stakeholder requirements), the designers adhere to the specified constraints
        that capability performance needs place on protection needs. The overall impact
        of computationally intensive security services (e.g., cryptography) are assessed
        and demonstrated to pose no significant impact to higher-priority performance
        considerations or are deemed to provide an acceptable trade-off of performance
        for trustworthy protection. The trade-off considerations include less computationally
        intensive security services unless they are unavailable or insufficient. The
        insufficiency of a security service is determined by functional capability
        and strength of mechanism. The strength of mechanism is selected with respect
        to security requirements, performance-critical overhead issues (e.g., cryptographic
        key management), and an assessment of the capability of the threat.

        The principle of performance security leads to the incorporation of features
        that help in the enforcement of security policy but incur minimum overhead,
        such as low-level hardware mechanisms upon which higher-level services can
        be built. Such low-level mechanisms are usually very specific, have very limited
        functionality, and are optimized for performance. For example, once access
        rights to a portion of memory is granted, many systems use hardware mechanisms
        to ensure that all further accesses involve the correct memory address and
        access mode. Application of this principle reinforces the need to design security
        into the system from the ground up and to incorporate simple mechanisms at
        the lower layers that can be used as building blocks for higher-level mechanisms.'

        Procedures
      description: 'Implement the security design principle of repeatable and documented
        procedures in [Assignment: organization-defined systems or system components].'
      annotation: The principle of repeatable and documented procedures states that
        the techniques and methods employed to construct a system component permit
        the same component to be completely and correctly reconstructed at a later
        time. Repeatable and documented procedures support the development of a component
        that is identical to the component created earlier, which may be in widespread
        use. In the case of other system artifacts (e.g., documentation and testing
        results), repeatability supports consistency and the ability to inspect the
        artifacts. Repeatable and documented procedures can be introduced at various
        stages within the system development life cycle and contribute to the ability
        to evaluate assurance claims for the system. Examples include systematic procedures
        for code development and review, procedures for the configuration management
        of development tools and system artifacts, and procedures for system delivery.

      description: 'Implement the security design principle of procedural rigor in
        [Assignment: organization-defined systems or system components].'
      annotation: 'The principle of procedural rigor states that the rigor of a system
        life cycle process is commensurate with its intended trustworthiness. Procedural
        rigor defines the scope, depth, and detail of the system life cycle procedures.
        Rigorous system life cycle procedures contribute to the assurance that the
        system is correct and free of unintended functionality in several ways. First,
        the procedures impose checks and balances on the life cycle process such that
        the introduction of unspecified functionality is prevented.

        Second, rigorous procedures applied to systems security engineering activities
        that produce specifications and other system design documents contribute to
        the ability to understand the system as it has been built rather than trusting
        that the component, as implemented, is the authoritative (and potentially
        misleading) specification.

        Finally, modifications to an existing system component are easier when there
        are detailed specifications that describe its current design instead of studying
        source code or schematics to try to understand how it works. Procedural rigor
        helps ensure that security functional and assurance requirements have been
        satisfied, and it contributes to a better-informed basis for the determination
        of trustworthiness and risk posture. Procedural rigor is commensurate with
        the degree of assurance desired for the system. If the required trustworthiness
        of the system is low, a high level of procedural rigor may add unnecessary
        cost, whereas when high trustworthiness is critical, the cost of high procedural
        rigor is merited.'

      description: 'Implement the security design principle of secure system modification
        in [Assignment: organization-defined systems or system components].'
      annotation: The principle of secure system modification states that system modification
        maintains system security with respect to the security requirements and risk
        tolerance of stakeholders. Upgrades or modifications to systems can transform
        secure systems into systems that are not secure. The procedures for system
        modification ensure that if the system is to maintain its trustworthiness,
        the same rigor that was applied to its initial development is applied to any
        system changes. Because modifications can affect the ability of the system
        to maintain its secure state, a careful security analysis of the modification
        is needed prior to its implementation and deployment. This principle parallels
        the principle of secure evolvability.

      description: 'Implement the security design principle of sufficient documentation

      annotation: The principle of sufficient documentation states that organizational
        personnel with responsibilities to interact with the system are provided with
        adequate documentation and other information such that the personnel contribute
        to rather than detract from system security. Despite attempts to comply with
        principles such as human factored security and acceptable security, systems
        are inherently complex, and the design intent for the use of security mechanisms
        and the ramifications of the misuse or misconfiguration of security mechanisms
        are not always intuitively obvious. Uninformed and insufficiently trained
        users can introduce vulnerabilities due to errors of omission and commission.
        The availability of documentation and training can help to ensure a knowledgeable
        cadre of personnel, all of whom have a critical role in the achievement of
        principles such as continuous protection. Documentation is written clearly
        and supported by training that provides security awareness and understanding
        of security-relevant responsibilities.

      annotation: External system services are provided by an external provider, and
        the organization has no direct control over the implementation of the required
        controls or the assessment of control effectiveness. Organizations establish
        relationships with external service providers in a variety of ways, including
        through business partnerships, contracts, interagency agreements, lines of
        business arrangements, licensing agreements, joint ventures, and supply chain
        exchanges. The responsibility for managing risks from the use of external
        system services remains with authorizing officials. For services external
        to organizations, a chain of trust requires that organizations establish and
        retain a certain level of confidence that each provider in the consumer-provider
        relationship provides adequate protection for the services rendered. The extent
        and nature of this chain of trust vary based on relationships between organizations
        and the external providers. Organizations document the basis for the trust
        relationships so that the relationships can be monitored. External system
        services documentation includes government, service providers, end user security
        roles and responsibilities, and service-level agreements. Service-level agreements
        define the expectations of performance for implemented controls, describe
        measurable outcomes, and identify remedies and response requirements for identified
        instances of noncompliance.

      annotation: Trust relationships between organizations and external service providers
        reflect the degree of confidence that the risk from using external services
        is at an acceptable level. Trust relationships can help organizations gain
        increased levels of confidence that service providers are providing adequate
        protection for the services rendered and can also be useful when conducting
        incident response or when planning for upgrades or obsolescence. Trust relationships
        can be complicated due to the potentially large number of entities participating
        in the consumer-provider interactions, subordinate relationships and levels
        of trust, and types of interactions between the parties. In some cases, the
        degree of trust is based on the level of control that organizations can exert
        on external service providers regarding the controls necessary for the protection
        of the service, information, or individual privacy and the evidence brought
        forth as to the effectiveness of the implemented controls. The level of control
        is established by the terms and conditions of the contracts or service-level

      annotation: As organizations increasingly use external service providers, it
        is possible that the interests of the service providers may diverge from organizational

        or operational controls in place may not be sufficient if the providers that
        implement and manage those controls are not operating in a manner consistent
        with the interests of the consuming organizations. Actions that organizations
        take to address such concerns include requiring background checks for selected
        service provider personnel; examining ownership records; employing only trustworthy
        service providers, such as providers with which organizations have had successful
        trust relationships; and conducting routine, periodic, unscheduled visits
        to service provider facilities.

        to successfully execute their mission and business functions. The impact occurs
        when external providers control the location of processing, storage, or services.

        storage, or service locations may be different from the criteria that organizations
        use. For example, organizations may desire that data or information storage
        locations be restricted to certain locations to help facilitate incident response
        activities in case of information security incidents or breaches. Incident
        response activities, including forensic analyses and after-the-fact investigations,
        may be adversely affected by the governing laws, policies, or protocols in

      description: Require the developer of the system, system component, or system
        service to employ static code analysis tools to identify common flaws and
        document the results of the analysis.
      annotation: Static code analysis provides a technology and methodology for security
        reviews and includes checking for weaknesses in the code as well as for the
        incorporation of libraries or other included code with known vulnerabilities
        or that are out-of-date and not supported. Static code analysis can be used
        to identify vulnerabilities and enforce secure coding practices. It is most
        effective when used early in the development process, when each code change
        can automatically be scanned for potential weaknesses. Static code analysis
        can provide clear remediation guidance and identify defects for developers
        to fix. Evidence of the correct implementation of static analysis can include
        aggregate defect density for critical defect types, evidence that defects
        were inspected by developers or security professionals, and evidence that
        defects were remediated. A high density of ignored findings, commonly referred
        to as false positives, indicates a potential problem with the analysis process
        or the analysis tool. In such cases, organizations weigh the validity of the
        evidence against evidence from other sources.

        (b) Under the following constraints: [Assignment: organization-defined constraints].'
      annotation: Penetration testing is an assessment methodology in which assessors,
        using all available information technology product or system documentation
        and working under specific constraints, attempt to circumvent the implemented
        security and privacy features of information technology products and systems.
        Useful information for assessors who conduct penetration testing includes
        product and system design specifications, source code, and administrator and
        operator manuals. Penetration testing can include white-box, gray-box, or
        black-box testing with analyses performed by skilled professionals who simulate
        adversary actions. The objective of penetration testing is to discover vulnerabilities
        in systems, system components, and services that result from implementation
        errors, configuration faults, or other operational weaknesses or deficiencies.
        Penetration tests can be performed in conjunction with automated and manual
        code reviews to provide a greater level of analysis than would ordinarily
        be possible. When user session information and other personally identifiable
        information is captured or recorded during penetration testing, such information
        is handled appropriately to protect privacy.

        changes. The correction of identified flaws includes deprecation of unsafe
        functions.

        Rigorously demonstrating control coverage at the highest levels of assurance

      description: Require the developer of the system, system component, or system
        service to employ dynamic code analysis tools to identify common flaws and
        document the results of the analysis.
      annotation: Dynamic code analysis provides runtime verification of software
        programs using tools capable of monitoring programs for memory corruption,
        user privilege issues, and other potential security problems. Dynamic code
        analysis employs runtime tools to ensure that security functionality performs
        in the way it was designed. A type of dynamic analysis, known as fuzz testing,
        induces program failures by deliberately introducing malformed or random data
        into software programs. Fuzz testing strategies are derived from the intended
        use of applications and the functional and design specifications for the applications.
        To understand the scope of dynamic code analysis and the assurance provided,
        organizations may also consider conducting code coverage analysis (i.e., checking
        the degree to which the code has been tested using metrics such as percent
        of subroutines tested or percent of program statements called during execution
        of the test suite) and/or concordance analysis (i.e., checking for words that
        are out of place in software code, such as non-English language words or derogatory
        terms).

      annotation: Interactive (also known as instrumentation-based) application security
        testing is a method of detecting vulnerabilities by observing applications
        as they run during testing. The use of instrumentation relies on direct measurements
        of the actual running applications and uses access to the code, user interaction,
        libraries, frameworks, backend connections, and configurations to directly
        measure control effectiveness. When combined with analysis techniques, interactive
        application security testing can identify a broad range of potential vulnerabilities
        and confirm control effectiveness. Instrumentation-based testing works in
        real time and can be used continuously throughout the system development life
        cycle.

      annotation: Organizations use quality metrics to establish acceptable levels
        of system quality. Metrics can include quality gates, which are collections
        of completion criteria or sufficiency standards that represent the satisfactory
        execution of specific phases of the system development project. For example,
        a quality gate may require the elimination of all compiler warnings or a determination
        that such warnings have no impact on the effectiveness of required security
        or privacy capabilities. During the execution phases of development projects,
        quality gates provide clear, unambiguous indications of progress. Other metrics
        apply to the entire development project. Metrics can include defining the
        severity thresholds of vulnerabilities in accordance with organizational risk
        tolerance, such as requiring no known vulnerabilities in the delivered system
        with a Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) severity of medium or high.

        (b) At the following level of rigor: [Assignment: organization-defined breadth
        and depth of criticality analysis].'
      annotation: Criticality analysis performed by the developer provides input to
        the criticality analysis performed by organizations. Developer input is essential
        to organizational criticality analysis because organizations may not have
        access to detailed design documentation for system components that are developed
        as commercial off-the-shelf products. Such design documentation includes functional
        specifications, high-level designs, low-level designs, source code, and hardware
        schematics. Criticality analysis is important for organizational systems that
        are designated as high value assets. High value assets can be moderate- or
        high-impact systems due to heightened adversarial interest or potential adverse
        effects on the federal enterprise. Developer input is especially important
        when organizations conduct supply chain criticality analyses.

      annotation: Attack surface reduction is closely aligned with threat and vulnerability
        analyses and system architecture and design. Attack surface reduction is a
        means of reducing risk to organizations by giving attackers less opportunity
        to exploit weaknesses or deficiencies (i.e., potential vulnerabilities) within
        systems, system components, and system services. Attack surface reduction
        includes implementing the concept of layered defenses, applying the principles
        of least privilege and least functionality, applying secure software development
        practices, deprecating unsafe functions, reducing entry points available to
        unauthorized users, reducing the amount of code that executes, and eliminating
        application programming interfaces (APIs) that are vulnerable to attacks.

        especially important when organizations outsource the development of systems,
        system components, or system services and when there is a requirement to demonstrate
        consistency with the enterprise architecture and security and privacy architecture
        of the organization. ISO 15408-2, ISO 15408-3, and SP 800-160-1 provide information
        on security architecture and design, including formal policy models, security-relevant
        components, formal and informal correspondence, conceptually simple design,

      annotation: Correspondence is an important part of the assurance gained through
        modeling. It demonstrates that the implementation is an accurate transformation
        of the model, and that any additional code or implementation details that
        are present have no impact on the behaviors or policies being modeled. Formal
        methods can be used to show that the high-level security properties are satisfied
        by the formal system description, and that the formal system description is
        correctly implemented by a description of some lower level, including a hardware
        description. Consistency between the formal top-level specification and the
        formal policy models is generally not amenable to being fully proven. Therefore,
        a combination of formal and informal methods may be needed to demonstrate
        such consistency. Consistency between the formal top-level specification and
        the actual implementation may require the use of an informal demonstration
        due to limitations on the applicability of formal methods to prove that the
        specification accurately reflects the implementation. Hardware, software,
        and firmware mechanisms internal to security-relevant components include mapping
        registers and direct memory input and output.

        hardware, software, and firmware in terms of exceptions, error messages, and
        effects;

        (b) Show via [Selection: informal demonstration; convincing argument with
        formal methods as feasible] that the descriptive top-level specification is
        consistent with the formal policy model;

        (c) Show via informal demonstration, that the descriptive top-level specification
        completely covers the interfaces to security-relevant hardware, software,
        and firmware;

        (d) Show that the descriptive top-level specification is an accurate description
        of the interfaces to security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware; and

        (e) Describe the security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware mechanisms
        not addressed in the descriptive top-level specification but strictly internal
        to the security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware.'
      annotation: Correspondence is an important part of the assurance gained through
        modeling. It demonstrates that the implementation is an accurate transformation
        of the model, and that additional code or implementation detail has no impact
        on the behaviors or policies being modeled. Consistency between the descriptive
        top-level specification (i.e., high-level/low-level design) and the formal
        policy model is generally not amenable to being fully proven. Therefore, a
        combination of formal and informal methods may be needed to show such consistency.
        Hardware, software, and firmware mechanisms strictly internal to security-relevant
        hardware, software, and firmware include mapping registers and direct memory
        input and output.

      description: 'Require the developer of the system, system component, or system
        service to:

        (a) Design and structure the security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware

        defined semantics; and

        (b) Internally structure the security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware
        with specific regard for this mechanism.'
      annotation: The principle of reduced complexity states that the system design
        is as simple and small as possible (see SA-8(7)). A small and simple design
        is easier to understand and analyze and is also less prone to error (see AC-25,
        SA-8(13)). The principle of reduced complexity applies to any aspect of a
        system, but it has particular importance for security due to the various analyses
        performed to obtain evidence about the emergent security property of the system.
        For such analyses to be successful, a small and simple design is essential.
        Application of the principle of reduced complexity contributes to the ability
        of system developers to understand the correctness and completeness of system
        security functions and facilitates the identification of potential vulnerabilities.
        The corollary of reduced complexity states that the simplicity of the system
        is directly related to the number of vulnerabilities it will contain. That
        is, simpler systems contain fewer vulnerabilities. An important benefit of
        reduced complexity is that it is easier to understand whether the security
        policy has been captured in the system design and that fewer vulnerabilities
        are likely to be introduced during engineering development. An additional
        benefit is that any such conclusion about correctness, completeness, and existence
        of vulnerabilities can be reached with a higher degree of assurance in contrast
        to conclusions reached in situations where the system design is inherently
        more complex.

        Least Privilege
      description: Require the developer of the system, system component, or system
        service to structure security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware to
        facilitate controlling access with least privilege.
      annotation: "The principle of least privilege states that each component is\
        \ allocated sufficient privileges to accomplish its specified functions but\
        \ no more (see SA-8(14)). Applying the principle of least privilege limits\
        \ the scope of the component\u2019s actions, which has two desirable effects.\
        \ First, the security impact of a failure, corruption, or misuse of the system\
        \ component results in a minimized security impact. Second, the security analysis\
        \ of the component is simplified. Least privilege is a pervasive principle\
        \ that is reflected in all aspects of the secure system design. Interfaces\
        \ used to invoke component capability are available to only certain subsets\
        \ of the user population, and component design supports a sufficiently fine\
        \ granularity of privilege decomposition. For example, in the case of an audit\
        \ mechanism, there may be an interface for the audit manager, who configures\
        \ the audit settings; an interface for the audit operator, who ensures that\
        \ audit data is safely collected and stored; and, finally, yet another interface\
        \ for the audit reviewer, who only has a need to view the audit data that\
        \ has been collected but no need to perform operations on that data.\nIn addition\
        \ to its manifestations at the system interface, least privilege can be used\
        \ as a guiding principle for the internal structure of the system itself.\
        \ One aspect of internal least privilege is to construct modules so that only\
        \ the elements encapsulated by the module are directly operated upon by the\
        \ functions within the module. Elements external to a module that may be affected\
        \ by the module\u2019s operation are indirectly accessed through interaction\
        \ (e.g., via a function call) with the module that contains those elements.\
        \ Another aspect of internal least privilege is that the scope of a given\
        \ module or component includes only those system elements that are necessary\
        \ for its functionality, and the access modes to the elements (e.g., read,\
        \ write) are minimal."

      annotation: Security resources that are distributed, located at different layers

        of the behavior of security resources (e.g., by ensuring that one patch is
        installed across all resources before making a configuration change that assumes
        that the patch is propagated) can avert such negative interactions.

      description: 'Use different designs for [Assignment: organization-defined critical
        systems or system components] to satisfy a common set of requirements or to
        provide equivalent functionality.'
      annotation: Design diversity is achieved by supplying the same requirements
        specification to multiple developers, each of whom is responsible for developing
        a variant of the system or system component that meets the requirements. Variants
        can be in software design, in hardware design, or in both hardware and a software
        design. Differences in the designs of the variants can result from developer
        experience (e.g., prior use of a design pattern), design style (e.g., when
        decomposing a required function into smaller tasks, determining what constitutes
        a separate task and how far to decompose tasks into sub-tasks), selection
        of libraries to incorporate into the variant, and the development environment
        (e.g., different design tools make some design patterns easier to visualize).
        Hardware design diversity includes making different decisions about what information
        to keep in analog form and what information to convert to digital form, transmitting
        the same information at different times, and introducing delays in sampling
        (temporal diversity). Design diversity is commonly used to support fault tolerance.

        Security and privacy program policies and procedures at the organization level
        are preferable, in general, and may obviate the need for mission- or system-specific
        policies and procedures. The policy can be included as part of the general

        Procedures can be documented in system security and privacy plans or in one
        or more separate documents. Events that may precipitate an update to system
        and communications protection policy and procedures include assessment or

        functions includes web administrative interfaces that employ separate authentication
        methods for users of any other system resources. Separation of system and
        user functions may include isolating administrative interfaces on different
        domains and with additional access controls. The separation of system and
        user functionality can be achieved by applying the systems security engineering
        design principles in SA-8, including SA-8(1), SA-8(3), SA-8(4), SA-8(10),
        SA-8(12), SA-8(13), SA-8(14), and SA-8(18).

      name: Security Function Isolation
      description: Isolate security functions from nonsecurity functions.
      annotation: Security functions are isolated from nonsecurity functions by means
        of an isolation boundary implemented within a system via partitions and domains.
        The isolation boundary controls access to and protects the integrity of the
        hardware, software, and firmware that perform system security functions. Systems
        implement code separation in many ways, such as through the provision of security
        kernels via processor rings or processor modes. For non-kernel code, security
        function isolation is often achieved through file system protections that
        protect the code on disk and address space protections that protect executing
        code. Systems can restrict access to security functions using access control
        mechanisms and by implementing least privilege capabilities. While the ideal
        is for all code within the defined security function isolation boundary to
        only contain security-relevant code, it is sometimes necessary to include
        nonsecurity functions as an exception. The isolation of security functions
        from nonsecurity functions can be achieved by applying the systems security
        engineering design principles in SA-8, including SA-8(1), SA-8(3), SA-8(4),
        SA-8(10), SA-8(12), SA-8(13), SA-8(14), and SA-8(18).

        potentially isolated from access and flow control enforcement functions include
        auditing, intrusion detection, and malicious code protection functions.

      name: Security Function Isolation | Minimize Nonsecurity Functionality
      description: Minimize the number of nonsecurity functions included within the
        isolation boundary containing security functions.
      annotation: Where it is not feasible to achieve strict isolation of nonsecurity
        functions from security functions, it is necessary to take actions to minimize
        nonsecurity-relevant functions within the security function boundary. Nonsecurity
        functions contained within the isolation boundary are considered security-relevant
        because errors or malicious code in the software can directly impact the security
        functions of systems. The fundamental design objective is that the specific
        portions of systems that provide information security are of minimal size
        and complexity. Minimizing the number of nonsecurity functions in the security-relevant
        system components allows designers and implementers to focus only on those
        functions which are necessary to provide the desired security capability (typically
        access enforcement). By minimizing the nonsecurity functions within the isolation
        boundaries, the amount of code that is trusted to enforce security policies
        is significantly reduced, thus contributing to understandability.

      description: Implement security functions as largely independent modules that
        maximize internal cohesiveness within modules and minimize coupling between
        modules.
      annotation: The reduction of inter-module interactions helps to constrain security
        functions and manage complexity. The concepts of coupling and cohesion are
        important with respect to modularity in software design. Coupling refers to
        the dependencies that one module has on other modules. Cohesion refers to
        the relationship between functions within a module. Best practices in software
        engineering and systems security engineering rely on layering, minimization,
        and modular decomposition to reduce and manage complexity. This produces software
        modules that are highly cohesive and loosely coupled.

      annotation: Preventing unauthorized and unintended information transfer via
        shared system resources stops information produced by the actions of prior
        users or roles (or the actions of processes acting on behalf of prior users
        or roles) from being available to current users or roles (or current processes
        acting on behalf of current users or roles) that obtain access to shared system
        resources after those resources have been released back to the system. Information
        in shared system resources also applies to encrypted representations of information.
        In other contexts, control of information in shared system resources is referred
        to as object reuse and residual information protection. Information in shared
        system resources does not address information remanence, which refers to the
        residual representation of data that has been nominally deleted; covert channels
        (including storage and timing channels), where shared system resources are
        manipulated to violate information flow restrictions; or components within
        systems for which there are only single users or roles.

        attacks can occur across a wide range of network protocols (e.g., IPv4, IPv6).
        A variety of technologies are available to limit or eliminate the origination
        and effects of denial-of-service events. For example, boundary protection
        devices can filter certain types of packets to protect system components on
        internal networks from being directly affected by or the source of denial-of-service
        attacks. Employing increased network capacity and bandwidth combined with
        service redundancy also reduces the susceptibility to denial-of-service events.

      annotation: Restricting the ability of individuals to launch denial-of-service

        Individuals of concern include hostile insiders or external adversaries who

        wireless networks, spoofed Internet protocol packets). Organizations can also
        limit the ability of individuals to use excessive system resources. Protection
        against individuals having the ability to launch denial-of-service attacks
        may be implemented on specific systems or boundary devices that prohibit egress
        to potential target systems.

        of network access enables a user to access remote devices and simultaneously,
        access uncontrolled networks. Split tunneling might be desirable by remote
        users to communicate with local system resources, such as printers or file
        servers. However, split tunneling can facilitate unauthorized external connections,
        making the system vulnerable to attack and to exfiltration of organizational
        information. Split tunneling can be prevented by disabling configuration settings
        that allow such capability in remote devices and by preventing those configuration
        settings from being configurable by users. Prevention can also be achieved
        by the detection of split tunneling (or of configuration settings that allow
        split tunneling) in the remote device, and by prohibiting the connection if
        the remote device is using split tunneling. A virtual private network (VPN)
        can be used to securely provision a split tunnel. A securely provisioned VPN
        includes locking connectivity to exclusive, managed, and named environments,
        or to a specific set of pre-approved addresses, without user control.

      description: 'Route [Assignment: organization-defined internal communications
        traffic] to [Assignment: organization-defined external networks] through authenticated
        proxy servers at managed interfaces.'
      annotation: External networks are networks outside of organizational control.
        A proxy server is a server (i.e., system or application) that acts as an intermediary
        for clients requesting system resources from non-organizational or other organizational
        servers. System resources that may be requested include files, connections,
        web pages, or services. Client requests established through a connection to
        a proxy server are assessed to manage complexity and provide additional protection
        by limiting direct connectivity. Web content filtering devices are one of
        the most common proxy servers that provide access to the Internet. Proxy servers
        can support the logging of Transmission Control Protocol sessions and the
        blocking of specific Uniform Resource Locators, Internet Protocol addresses,
        and domain names. Web proxies can be configured with organization-defined
        lists of authorized and unauthorized websites. Note that proxy servers may
        inhibit the use of virtual private networks (VPNs) and create the potential
        for man-in-the-middle attacks (depending on the implementation).

      annotation: Detecting outgoing communications traffic from internal actions
        that may pose threats to external systems is known as extrusion detection.
        Extrusion detection is carried out within the system at managed interfaces.
        Extrusion detection includes the analysis of incoming and outgoing communications
        traffic while searching for indications of internal threats to the security
        of external systems. Internal threats to external systems include traffic
        indicative of denial-of-service attacks, traffic with spoofed source addresses,
        and traffic that contains malicious code. Organizations have criteria to determine,
        update, and manage identified threats related to extrusion detection.

      annotation: Prevention of exfiltration applies to both the intentional and unintentional
        exfiltration of information. Techniques used to prevent the exfiltration of
        information from systems may be implemented at internal endpoints, external
        boundaries, and across managed interfaces and include adherence to protocol
        formats, monitoring for beaconing activity from systems, disconnecting external
        network interfaces except when explicitly needed, employing traffic profile
        analysis to detect deviations from the volume and types of traffic expected,
        call backs to command and control centers, conducting penetration testing,
        monitoring for steganography, disassembling and reassembling packet headers,
        and using data loss and data leakage prevention tools. Devices that enforce
        strict adherence to protocol formats include deep packet inspection firewalls
        and Extensible Markup Language (XML) gateways. The devices verify adherence
        to protocol formats and specifications at the application layer and identify
        vulnerabilities that cannot be detected by devices that operate at the network
        or transport layers. The prevention of exfiltration is similar to data loss
        prevention or data leakage prevention and is closely associated with cross-domain
        solutions and system guards that enforce information flow requirements.

      annotation: General source address validation techniques are applied to restrict
        the use of illegal and unallocated source addresses as well as source addresses
        that should only be used within the system. The restriction of incoming communications
        traffic provides determinations that source and destination address pairs
        represent authorized or allowed communications. Determinations can be based
        on several factors, including the presence of such address pairs in the lists
        of authorized or allowed communications, the absence of such address pairs
        in lists of unauthorized or disallowed pairs, or meeting more general rules
        for authorized or allowed source and destination pairs. Strong authentication
        of network addresses is not possible without the use of explicit security
        protocols, and thus, addresses can often be spoofed. Further, identity-based
        incoming traffic restriction methods can be employed, including router access
        control lists and firewall rules.

        can be achieved by using clearly identified and physically separated cable
        trays, connection frames, and patch panels for each side of managed interfaces
        with physical access controls that enforce limited authorized access to these
        items.

        flows among system components and provides the opportunity to deploy greater
        levels of protection for selected system components. Isolating system components
        with boundary protection mechanisms provides the capability for increased
        protection of individual system components and to more effectively control
        information flows between those components. Isolating system components provides
        enhanced protection that limits the potential harm from hostile cyber-attacks
        and errors. The degree of isolation varies depending upon the mechanisms chosen.
        Boundary protection mechanisms include routers, gateways, and firewalls that
        separate system components into physically separate networks or subnetworks;
        cross-domain devices that separate subnetworks; virtualization techniques;
        and the encryption of information flows among system components using distinct
        encryption keys.

        as commodity services rather than as fully dedicated services may find it
        difficult to obtain the necessary assurances regarding the implementation
        of needed controls for transmission confidentiality and integrity. In such
        situations, organizations determine what types of confidentiality or integrity
        services are available in standard, commercial telecommunications service
        packages. If it is not feasible to obtain the necessary controls and assurances
        of control effectiveness through appropriate contracting vehicles, organizations
        can implement appropriate compensating controls.'

      description: 'Implement cryptographic mechanisms to protect message externals

      annotation: Cryptographic protection for message externals addresses protection
        from the unauthorized disclosure of information. Message externals include
        message headers and routing information. Cryptographic protection prevents
        the exploitation of message externals and applies to internal and external
        networks or links that may be visible to individuals who are not authorized
        users. Header and routing information is sometimes transmitted in clear text
        (i.e., unencrypted) because the information is not identified by organizations
        as having significant value or because encrypting the information can result
        in lower network performance or higher costs. Alternative physical controls
        include protected distribution systems.

      description: 'Implement cryptographic mechanisms to conceal or randomize communication
        patterns unless otherwise protected by [Assignment: organization-defined alternative
        physical controls].'
      annotation: Concealing or randomizing communication patterns addresses protection
        from unauthorized disclosure of information. Communication patterns include
        frequency, periods, predictability, and amount. Changes to communications
        patterns can reveal information with intelligence value, especially when combined
        with other available information related to the mission and business functions
        of the organization. Concealing or randomizing communications prevents the
        derivation of intelligence based on communications patterns and applies to
        both internal and external networks or links that may be visible to individuals
        who are not authorized users. Encrypting the links and transmitting in continuous,
        fixed, or random patterns prevents the derivation of intelligence from the
        system communications patterns. Alternative physical controls include protected
        distribution systems.

        between the user and the following security functions of the system, including
        at a minimum, authentication and re-authentication: [Assignment: organization-defined
        security functions].'
      annotation: Trusted paths are mechanisms by which users can communicate (using
        input devices such as keyboards) directly with the security functions of systems
        with the requisite assurance to support security policies. Trusted path mechanisms
        can only be activated by users or the security functions of organizational
        systems. User responses that occur via trusted paths are protected from modification
        by and disclosure to untrusted applications. Organizations employ trusted
        paths for trustworthy, high-assurance connections between security functions
        of systems and users, including during system logons. The original implementations
        of trusted paths employed an out-of-band signal to initiate the path, such
        as using the <BREAK> key, which does not transmit characters that can be spoofed.
        In later implementations, a key combination that could not be hijacked was
        used (e.g., the <CTRL> + <ALT> + <DEL> keys). Such key combinations, however,
        are platform-specific and may not provide a trusted path implementation in
        every case. The enforcement of trusted communications paths is provided by
        a specific implementation that meets the reference monitor concept.

      annotation: An irrefutable communications path permits the system to initiate
        a trusted path, which necessitates that the user can unmistakably recognize
        the source of the communication as a trusted system component. For example,
        the trusted path may appear in an area of the display that other applications
        cannot access or be based on the presence of an identifier that cannot be
        spoofed.

        Organizations define key management requirements in accordance with applicable
        laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and

      annotation: Some attack vectors operate by altering the security attributes
        of an information system to intentionally and maliciously implement an insufficient
        level of security within the system. The alteration of attributes leads organizations
        to believe that a greater number of security functions are in place and operational
        than have actually been implemented.

        In cryptographic systems with a hierarchical structure, a trust anchor is
        an authoritative source (i.e., a certificate authority) for which trust is
        assumed and not derived. A root certificate for a PKI system is an example
        of a trust anchor. A trust store or certificate store maintains a list of
        trusted root certificates.

      annotation: Mobile code includes any program, application, or content that can
        be transmitted across a network (e.g., embedded in an email, document, or
        website) and executed on a remote system. Decisions regarding the use of mobile
        code within organizational systems are based on the potential for the code
        to cause damage to the systems if used maliciously. Mobile code technologies
        include Java applets, JavaScript, HTML5, WebGL, and VBScript. Usage restrictions
        and implementation guidelines apply to both the selection and use of mobile
        code installed on servers and mobile code downloaded and executed on individual
        workstations and devices, including notebook computers and smart phones. Mobile

        of the following information at rest: [Assignment: organization-defined information
        at rest].'
      annotation: Information at rest refers to the state of information when it is
        not in process or in transit and is located on system components. Such components
        include internal or external hard disk drives, storage area network devices,
        or databases. However, the focus of protecting information at rest is not
        on the type of storage device or frequency of access but rather on the state
        of the information. Information at rest addresses the confidentiality and
        integrity of information and covers user information and system information.
        System-related information that requires protection includes configurations
        or rule sets for firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention systems, filtering
        routers, and authentication information. Organizations may employ different
        mechanisms to achieve confidentiality and integrity protections, including
        the use of cryptographic mechanisms and file share scanning. Integrity protection
        can be achieved, for example, by implementing write-once-read-many (WORM)
        technologies. When adequate protection of information at rest cannot otherwise
        be achieved, organizations may employ other controls, including frequent scanning

        system components in the implementation of the system: [Assignment: organization-defined
        system components].'
      annotation: Increasing the diversity of information technologies within organizational
        systems reduces the impact of potential exploitations or compromises of specific
        technologies. Such diversity protects against common mode failures, including
        those failures induced by supply chain attacks. Diversity in information technologies
        also reduces the likelihood that the means adversaries use to compromise one
        system component will be effective against other system components, thus further
        increasing the adversary work factor to successfully complete planned attacks.
        An increase in diversity may add complexity and management overhead that could
        ultimately lead to mistakes and unauthorized configurations.

        in an increased work factor for adversaries to conduct successful attacks.
        Changing virtual operating systems or applications, as opposed to changing
        actual operating systems or applications, provides virtual changes that impede
        attacker success while reducing configuration management efforts. Virtualization
        techniques can assist in isolating untrustworthy software or software of dubious

      annotation: Randomness introduces increased levels of uncertainty for adversaries
        regarding the actions that organizations take to defend their systems against
        attacks. Such actions may impede the ability of adversaries to correctly target
        information resources of organizations that support critical missions or business
        functions. Uncertainty may also cause adversaries to hesitate before initiating
        or continuing attacks. Misdirection techniques that involve randomness include
        performing certain routine actions at different times of day, employing different
        information technologies, using different suppliers, and rotating roles and
        responsibilities of organizational personnel.

      annotation: Adversaries target critical mission and business functions and the
        systems that support those mission and business functions while also trying
        to minimize the exposure of their existence and tradecraft. The static, homogeneous,
        and deterministic nature of organizational systems targeted by adversaries
        make such systems more susceptible to attacks with less adversary cost and
        effort to be successful. Changing processing and storage locations (also referred
        to as moving target defense) addresses the advanced persistent threat using
        techniques such as virtualization, distributed processing, and replication.
        This enables organizations to relocate the system components (i.e., processing,
        storage) that support critical mission and business functions. Changing the
        locations of processing activities and/or storage sites introduces a degree
        of uncertainty into the targeting activities of adversaries. The targeting
        uncertainty increases the work factor of adversaries and makes compromises
        or breaches of the organizational systems more difficult and time-consuming.
        It also increases the chances that adversaries may inadvertently disclose
        certain aspects of their tradecraft while attempting to locate critical organizational
        resources.

        adversaries regarding the nature and extent of controls deployed by organizations.
        Thus, adversaries may employ incorrect and ineffective attack techniques.
        One technique for misleading adversaries is for organizations to place misleading
        information regarding the specific controls deployed in external systems that
        are known to be targeted by adversaries. Another technique is the use of deception
        nets that mimic actual aspects of organizational systems but use, for example,
        out-of-date software configurations.

      annotation: Out-of-band channels include local, non-network accesses to systems;
        network paths physically separate from network paths used for operational
        traffic; or non-electronic paths, such as the U.S. Postal Service. The use
        of out-of-band channels is contrasted with the use of in-band channels (i.e.,
        the same channels) that carry routine operational traffic. Out-of-band channels
        do not have the same vulnerability or exposure as in-band channels. Therefore,
        the confidentiality, integrity, or availability compromises of in-band channels
        will not compromise or adversely affect the out-of-band channels. Organizations
        may employ out-of-band channels in the delivery or transmission of organizational
        items, including authenticators and credentials; cryptographic key management
        information; system and data backups; configuration management changes for
        hardware, firmware, or software; security updates; maintenance information;
        and malicious code protection updates.

        of organizations by identifying, controlling, and protecting generally unclassified
        information that specifically relates to the planning and execution of sensitive

      description: Maintain a separate execution domain for each executing system
        process.
      annotation: Systems can maintain separate execution domains for each executing
        process by assigning each process a separate address space. Each system process
        has a distinct address space so that communication between processes is performed
        in a manner controlled through the security functions, and one process cannot
        modify the executing code of another process. Maintaining separate execution
        domains for executing processes can be achieved, for example, by implementing
        separate address spaces. Process isolation technologies, including sandboxing
        or virtualization, logically separate software and firmware from other software,
        firmware, and data. Process isolation helps limit the access of potentially
        untrusted software to other system resources. The capability to maintain separate
        execution domains is available in commercial operating systems that employ
        multi-state processor technologies.

      annotation: Wireless link protection applies to internal and external wireless

        attacks that are unique to wireless systems. If organizations rely on commercial
        service providers for transmission services as commodity items rather than
        as fully dedicated services, it may not be possible to implement wireless
        link protections to the extent necessary to meet organizational security requirements.

      annotation: The implementation of cryptographic mechanisms for electromagnetic
        interference protects systems against intentional jamming that might deny
        or impair communications by ensuring that wireless spread spectrum waveforms
        used to provide anti-jam protection are not predictable by unauthorized individuals.

        that share the same spectrum. Mission requirements, projected threats, concept

        that are embedded within mobile devices include microphones, cameras, Global
        Positioning System (GPS) mechanisms, and accelerometers. While the sensors
        on mobiles devices provide an important function, if activated covertly, such
        devices can potentially provide a means for adversaries to learn valuable
        information about individuals and organizations. For example, remotely activating
        the GPS function on a mobile device could provide an adversary with the ability

        assurance. Therefore, it is important that security and privacy programs collaborate
        on the development of system and information integrity policy and procedures.
        Security and privacy program policies and procedures at the organization level
        are preferable, in general, and may obviate the need for mission- or system-specific
        policies and procedures. The policy can be included as part of the general
        security and privacy policy or be represented by multiple policies that reflect
        the complex nature of organizations. Procedures can be established for security
        and privacy programs, for mission or business processes, and for systems,
        if needed. Procedures describe how the policies or controls are implemented
        and can be directed at the individual or role that is the object of the procedure.
        Procedures can be documented in system security and privacy plans or in one
        or more separate documents. Events that may precipitate an update to system
        and information integrity policy and procedures include assessment or audit
        findings, security incidents or breaches, or changes in applicable laws, executive
        orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines. Simply
        restating controls does not constitute an organizational policy or procedure.

        determine the type of testing needed for the specific type of flaw remediation
        activity under consideration and the types of changes that are to be configuration-managed.
        In some situations, organizations may determine that the testing of software

      annotation: 'System entry and exit points include firewalls, remote access servers,
        workstations, electronic mail servers, web servers, proxy servers, notebook
        computers, and mobile devices. Malicious code includes viruses, worms, Trojan
        horses, and spyware. Malicious code can also be encoded in various formats
        contained within compressed or hidden files or hidden in files using techniques
        such as steganography. Malicious code can be inserted into systems in a variety
        of ways, including by electronic mail, the world-wide web, and portable storage
        devices. Malicious code insertions occur through the exploitation of system
        vulnerabilities. A variety of technologies and methods exist to limit or eliminate
        the effects of malicious code.

        Malicious code protection mechanisms include both signature- and nonsignature-based
        technologies. Nonsignature-based detection mechanisms include artificial intelligence
        techniques that use heuristics to detect, analyze, and describe the characteristics
        or behavior of malicious code and to provide controls against such code for
        which signatures do not yet exist or for which existing signatures may not
        be effective. Malicious code for which active signatures do not yet exist
        or may be ineffective includes polymorphic malicious code (i.e., code that
        changes signatures when it replicates). Nonsignature-based mechanisms also
        include reputation-based technologies. In addition to the above technologies,
        pervasive configuration management, comprehensive software integrity controls,
        and anti-exploitation software may be effective in preventing the execution
        of unauthorized code. Malicious code may be present in commercial off-the-shelf
        software as well as custom-built software and could include logic bombs, backdoors,
        and other types of attacks that could affect organizational mission and business
        functions.

        In situations where malicious code cannot be detected by detection methods
        or technologies, organizations rely on other types of controls, including
        secure coding practices, configuration management and control, trusted procurement
        processes, and monitoring practices to ensure that software does not perform
        functions other than the functions intended. Organizations may determine that,
        in response to the detection of malicious code, different actions may be warranted.
        For example, organizations can define actions in response to malicious code
        detection during periodic scans, the detection of malicious downloads, or
        the detection of maliciousness when attempting to open or execute files.'

      annotation: The use of malicious code analysis tools provides organizations
        with a more in-depth understanding of adversary tradecraft (i.e., tactics,
        techniques, and procedures) and the functionality and purpose of specific
        instances of malicious code. Understanding the characteristics of malicious
        code facilitates effective organizational responses to current and future
        threats. Organizations can conduct malicious code analyses by employing reverse
        engineering techniques or by monitoring the behavior of executing code.

        more): as needed; [Assignment: organization-defined frequency]].'
      annotation: 'System monitoring includes external and internal monitoring. External
        monitoring includes the observation of events occurring at external interfaces
        to the system. Internal monitoring includes the observation of events occurring
        within the system. Organizations monitor systems by observing audit activities
        in real time or by observing other system aspects such as access patterns,
        characteristics of access, and other actions. The monitoring objectives guide
        and inform the determination of the events. System monitoring capabilities
        are achieved through a variety of tools and techniques, including intrusion
        detection and prevention systems, malicious code protection software, scanning
        tools, audit record monitoring software, and network monitoring software.

        Depending on the security architecture, the distribution and configuration
        of monitoring devices may impact throughput at key internal and external boundaries
        as well as at other locations across a network due to the introduction of
        network throughput latency. If throughput management is needed, such devices
        are strategically located and deployed as part of an established organization-wide
        security architecture. Strategic locations for monitoring devices include
        selected perimeter locations and near key servers and server farms that support
        critical applications. Monitoring devices are typically employed at the managed
        interfaces associated with controls SC-7 and AC-17. The information collected
        is a function of the organizational monitoring objectives and the capability
        of systems to support such objectives. Specific types of transactions of interest
        include Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) traffic that bypasses HTTP proxies.
        System monitoring is an integral part of organizational continuous monitoring
        and incident response programs, and output from system monitoring serves as
        input to those programs. System monitoring requirements, including the need
        for specific types of system monitoring, may be referenced in other controls
        (e.g., AC-2g, AC-2(7), AC-2(12)(a), AC-17(1), AU-13, AU-13(1), AU-13(2), CM-3f,
        CM-6d, MA-3a, MA-4a, SC-5(3)(b), SC-7a, SC-7(24)(b), SC-18b, SC-43b). Adjustments
        to levels of system monitoring are based on law enforcement information, intelligence
        information, or other sources of information. The legality of system monitoring
        activities is based on applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations,
        policies, standards, and guidelines.'

        with unintended consequences. Organizations assess and document these risks
        in their privacy impact assessment and make determinations that are in alignment

      description: Employ an intrusion detection system to monitor wireless communications
        traffic as the traffic passes from wireless to wireline networks.
      annotation: Wireless networks are inherently less secure than wired networks.
        For example, wireless networks are more susceptible to eavesdroppers or traffic
        analysis than wireline networks. When wireless to wireline communications
        exist, the wireless network could become a port of entry into the wired network.
        Given the greater facility of unauthorized network access via wireless access
        points compared to unauthorized wired network access from within the physical
        boundaries of the system, additional monitoring of transitioning traffic between
        wireless and wired networks may be necessary to detect malicious activities.
        Employing intrusion detection systems to monitor wireless communications traffic

      annotation: Indicators of compromise (IOC) are forensic artifacts from intrusions
        that are identified on organizational systems at the host or network level.
        IOCs provide valuable information on systems that have been compromised. IOCs
        can include the creation of registry key values. IOCs for network traffic
        include Universal Resource Locator or protocol elements that indicate malicious
        code command and control servers. The rapid distribution and adoption of IOCs
        can improve information security by reducing the time that systems and organizations
        are vulnerable to the same exploit or attack. Threat indicators, signatures,
        tactics, techniques, procedures, and other indicators of compromise may be
        available via government and non-government cooperatives, including the Forum
        of Incident Response and Security Teams, the United States Computer Emergency
        Readiness Team, the Defense Industrial Base Cybersecurity Information Sharing
        Program, and the CERT Coordination Center.

      description: Account for timing interactions among system components in determining

      annotation: In addressing invalid system inputs received across protocol interfaces,
        timing interactions become relevant, where one protocol needs to consider
        the impact of the error response on other protocols in the protocol stack.
        For example, 802.11 standard wireless network protocols do not interact well
        with Transmission Control Protocols (TCP) when packets are dropped (which
        could be due to invalid packet input). TCP assumes packet losses are due to
        congestion, while packets lost over 802.11 links are typically dropped due
        to noise or collisions on the link. If TCP makes a congestion response, it
        takes the wrong action in response to a collision event. Adversaries may be
        able to use what appear to be acceptable individual behaviors of the protocols
        in concert to achieve adverse effects through suitable construction of invalid
        input. The invalid inputs are those related to the information inputs defined
        by the organization in the base control (SI-10).

        components and services] that are initiated in a known state and terminated
        [Selection (one or more): upon end of session of use; periodically at [Assignment:
        organization-defined frequency]].'
      annotation: 'Implementation of non-persistent components and services mitigates
        risk from advanced persistent threats (APTs) by reducing the targeting capability
        of adversaries (i.e., window of opportunity and available attack surface)
        to initiate and complete attacks. By implementing the concept of non-persistence
        for selected system components, organizations can provide a trusted, known
        state computing resource for a specific time period that does not give adversaries
        sufficient time to exploit vulnerabilities in organizational systems or operating
        environments. Since the APT is a high-end, sophisticated threat with regard
        to capability, intent, and targeting, organizations assume that over an extended
        period, a percentage of attacks will be successful. Non-persistent system
        components and services are activated as required using protected information
        and terminated periodically or at the end of sessions. Non-persistence increases
        the work factor of adversaries attempting to compromise or breach organizational
        systems.

        Non-persistence can be achieved by refreshing system components, periodically
        reimaging components, or using a variety of common virtualization techniques.
        Non-persistent services can be implemented by using virtualization techniques
        as part of virtual machines or as new instances of processes on physical machines
        (either persistent or non-persistent). The benefit of periodic refreshes of
        system components and services is that it does not require organizations to
        first determine whether compromises of components or services have occurred
        (something that may often be difficult to determine). The refresh of selected
        system components and services occurs with sufficient frequency to prevent
        the spread or intended impact of attacks, but not with such frequency that
        it makes the system unstable. Refreshes of critical components and services
        may be done periodically to hinder the ability of adversaries to exploit optimum
        windows of vulnerabilities.'

      annotation: There are many possible processes for removing direct identifiers
        from a dataset. Columns in a dataset that contain a direct identifier can
        be removed. In masking, the direct identifier is transformed into a repeating
        character, such as XXXXXX or 999999.  Identifiers can be encrypted or hashed
        so that the linked records remain linked. In the case of encryption or hashing,
        algorithms are employed that require the use of a key, including the Advanced
        Encryption Standard or a Hash-based Message Authentication Code. Implementations
        may use the same key for all identifiers or use a different key for each identifier.
        Using a different key for each identifier provides a higher degree of security
        and privacy. Identifiers can alternatively be replaced with a keyword, including
        transforming George Washington to PATIENT or replacing it with a surrogate
        value, such as transforming George Washington to Abraham Polk.

      description: Prevent disclosure of personally identifiable information by adding

      annotation: The mathematical definition for differential privacy holds that
        the result of a dataset analysis should be approximately the same before and
        after the addition or removal of a single data record (which is assumed to
        be the data from a single individual). In its most basic form, differential
        privacy applies only to online query systems. However, it can also be used
        to produce machine-learning statistical classifiers and synthetic data. Differential
        privacy comes at the cost of decreased accuracy of results, forcing organizations
        to quantify the trade-off between privacy protection and the overall accuracy,
        usefulness, and utility of the de-identified dataset. Non-deterministic noise
        can include adding small, random values to the results of mathematical operations
        in dataset analysis.

        be re-identified.
      annotation: A motivated intruder test is a test in which an individual or group
        takes a data release and specified resources and attempts to re-identify one
        or more individuals in the de-identified dataset. Such tests specify the amount
        of inside knowledge, computational resources, financial resources, data, and
        skills that intruders possess to conduct the tests. A motivated intruder test
        can determine if the de-identification is insufficient. It can also be a useful
        diagnostic tool to assess if de-identification is likely to be sufficient.
        However, the test alone cannot prove that de-identification is sufficient.

      description: 'Embed data or capabilities in the following systems or system
        components to determine if organizational data has been exfiltrated or improperly
        removed from the organization: [Assignment: organization-defined systems or
        system components].'
      annotation: Many cyber-attacks target organizational information, or information
        that the organization holds on behalf of other entities (e.g., personally
        identifiable information), and exfiltrate that data. In addition, insider
        attacks and erroneous user procedures can remove information from the system
        that is in violation of the organizational policies. Tainting approaches can
        range from passive to active. A passive tainting approach can be as simple
        as adding false email names and addresses to an internal database. If the
        organization receives email at one of the false email addresses, it knows
        that the database has been compromised. Moreover, the organization knows that
        the email was sent by an unauthorized entity, so any packets it includes potentially
        contain malicious code, and that the unauthorized entity may have potentially
        obtained a copy of the database. Another tainting approach can include embedding
        false data or steganographic data in files to enable the data to be found
        via open-source analysis. Finally, an active tainting approach can include
        embedding software in the data that is able to call home, thereby alerting
        the organization to its capture, and possibly its location, and the path by
        which it was exfiltrated or removed.

      annotation: Actions taken by a system service or a function are often driven

        or no longer available. It is possible that the alternative sources of information
        may be less precise or less accurate than the primary source of information.
        But having such sub-optimal information sources may still provide a sufficient
        level of quality that the essential service or function can be carried out,

        strategy is an important factor in establishing such policies and procedures.
        Policies and procedures contribute to security and privacy assurance. Therefore,
        it is important that security and privacy programs collaborate on the development
        of supply chain risk management policy and procedures. Security and privacy
        program policies and procedures at the organization level are preferable,
        in general, and may obviate the need for mission- or system-specific policies
        and procedures. The policy can be included as part of the general security

        and can be directed at the individual or role that is the object of the procedure.
        Procedures can be documented in system security and privacy plans or in one

        chain elements include organizations, entities, or tools used for the research
        and development, design, manufacturing, acquisition, delivery, integration,

      annotation: Tracking the unique identification of systems and system components
        during development and transport activities provides a foundational identity
        structure for the establishment and maintenance of provenance. For example,
        system components may be labeled using serial numbers or tagged using radio-frequency
        identification tags. Labels and tags can help provide better visibility into
        the provenance of a system or system component. A system or system component
        may have more than one unique identifier. Identification methods are sufficient
        to support a forensic investigation after a supply chain compromise or event.

      description: 'Employ the following controls to validate that the system or system
        component received is genuine and has not been altered: [Assignment: organization-defined
        controls].'
      annotation: For many systems and system components, especially hardware, there
        are technical means to determine if the items are genuine or have been altered,
        including optical and nanotechnology tagging, physically unclonable functions,
        side-channel analysis, cryptographic hash verifications or digital signatures,
        and visible anti-tamper labels or stickers. Controls can also include monitoring
        for out of specification performance, which can be an indicator of tampering
        or counterfeits. Organizations may leverage supplier and contractor processes
        for validating that a system or component is genuine and has not been altered
        and for replacing a suspect system or component. Some indications of tampering
        may be visible and addressable before accepting delivery, such as inconsistent
        packaging, broken seals, and incorrect labels. When a system or system component
        is suspected of being altered or counterfeit, the supplier, contractor, or
        original equipment manufacturer may be able to replace the item or provide
        a forensic capability to determine the origin of the counterfeit or altered
        item. Organizations can provide training to personnel on how to identify suspicious
        system or component deliveries.

        tools, and procurement methods].'
      annotation: The use of the acquisition process provides an important vehicle
        to protect the supply chain. There are many useful tools and techniques available,
        including obscuring the end use of a system or system component, using blind
        or filtered buys, requiring tamper-evident packaging, or using trusted or
        controlled distribution. The results from a supply chain risk assessment can
        guide and inform the strategies, tools, and methods that are most applicable
        to the situation. Tools and techniques may provide protections against unauthorized
        production, theft, tampering, insertion of counterfeits, insertion of malicious
        software or backdoors, and poor development practices throughout the system
        development life cycle. Organizations also consider providing incentives for
        suppliers who implement controls, promote transparency into their processes
        and security and privacy practices, provide contract language that addresses
        the prohibition of tainted or counterfeit components, and restrict purchases
        from untrustworthy suppliers. Organizations consider providing training, education,
        and awareness programs for personnel regarding supply chain risk, available
        mitigation strategies, and when the programs should be employed. Methods for
        reviewing and protecting development plans, documentation, and evidence are
        commensurate with the security and privacy requirements of the organization.
        Contracts may specify documentation protection requirements.

        Organizations may track systems and component mean time to failure to mitigate
        the loss of temporary or permanent system function. Controls to ensure that
        adequate supplies of critical system components include the use of multiple
        suppliers throughout the supply chain for the identified critical components,
        stockpiling spare components to ensure operation during mission-critical times,
        and the identification of functionally identical or similar components that
        may be used, if necessary.

      annotation: An assessment and review of supplier risk includes security and
        supply chain risk management processes, foreign ownership, control or influence
        (FOCI), and the ability of the supplier to effectively assess subordinate
        second-tier and third-tier suppliers and contractors. The reviews may be conducted
        by the organization or by an independent third party. The reviews consider
        documented processes, documented controls, all-source intelligence, and publicly
        available information related to the supplier or contractor. Organizations
        can use open-source information to monitor for indications of stolen information,
        poor development and quality control practices, information spillage, or counterfeits.
        In some cases, it may be appropriate or required to share assessment and review
        results with other organizations in accordance with any applicable rules,
