        service providers' subcontracting practices. Ensure these providers actively
        engage in operational reporting and testing, demonstrating their ability to
        assess subcontractor capabilities effectively. Require active involvement
        and notification of the financial entity in subcontracting decisions, ensuring
        alignment with contractual arrangements. Verify that subcontracting agreements
        reflect the terms and conditions outlined in the primary contract between
        the financial entity and the third-party provider. Assess the third-party
        provider's organizational structure, resources, and information security standards,
        including incident response and risk management mechanisms. Mitigate risks
        associated with subcontractor failure and geographical location, considering
        potential impacts on digital operational resilience and financial stability.
        Address any barriers to audit and access rights for competent authorities
        and the financial institution.
