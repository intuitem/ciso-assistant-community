        documentation, or identified as forbidden in the platform configuration.


        Verify that the hardware platform drops the message, does not reply, and does
        not change any configuration when it receives commands through unneeded interfaces.
        This verification can be conducted by the following test steps:

        - The tester sends ping messages to an unneeded interface of the hardware
        platform.

        - The tester verifies, through a network traffic analyser, that the pings
        reach the unneeded interface of the hardware platform, but they are dropped,
        and no response is sent back since the source of the received packet is not
        reachable through the interface it came in.

        - If the dropped packets are logged, the tester verifies that these packets
        are recorded.


        A documented process is in place indicating a list of interfaces to be disabled
        and the steps to be followed for disabling them securely. Hardware platform
        logs confirm the disabled interfaces and conformity with the documented processes.'
