        and then includes the access token/ticket in the Request. The integrity verification
        by NFV resources of the access token/ticket fails.

        2. Compute an access token/ticket correctly, except that the expiration time
        has expired against the current data/time, and then includes the access token/ticket
        in the Request sent to NFV resources. NFV verifies that the integrity of the
