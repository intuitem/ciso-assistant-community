      description: "Situational awareness refers to an FMI\u2019s understanding of\
        \ the cyber threat environment within which it operates, and the implications\
        \ of being in that environment for its business and the adequacy of its cyber\
        \ risk mitigation measures. Strong situational awareness, acquired through\
        \ an effective cyber threat intelligence process can make a significant difference\
        \ in the FMI\u2019s ability to pre-empt cyber events or respond rapidly and\
        \ effectively to them. Specifically, a keen appreciation of the threat landscape\
        \ can help an FMI better understand the vulnerabilities in its critical business\
        \ functions, and facilitate the adoption of appropriate risk mitigation strategies.\
        \ It can also enable an FMI to validate its strategic direction, resource\
        \ allocation, processes, procedures and controls with respect to building\
        \ its cyber resilience. A key means of achieving situational awareness for\
        \ an FMI and its ecosystem is an FMI\u2019s active participation in information-sharing\
        \ arrangements and collaboration with trusted stakeholders within and outside\
        \ the industry. This chapter provides guidance for FMIs to establish a cyber\
        \ threat intelligence process, analysis and sharing processes."

      description: "An FMI\u2019s cyber resilience framework needs to achieve continuous\
        \ cyber resilience amid a changing threat environment. To be effective in\
        \ keeping pace with the rapid evolution of cyber threats, an FMI should implement\
        \ an adaptive cyber resilience framework that evolves with the dynamic nature\
        \ of cyber risks and allows the FMI to identify, assess and manage security\
        \ threats and vulnerabilities for the purpose of implementing appropriate\
        \ safeguards into its systems. An FMI should aim to instil a culture of cyber\
        \ risk awareness whereby its resilience posture, at every level, is regularly\
        \ and frequently re-evaluated."
