      description: 'The MAP function establishes the context to frame risks related
        to an AI system. The AI lifecycle consists of many interdependent activities
        involving a diverse set of actors (See Figure 3). In practice, AI actors in
        charge of one part of the process often do not have full visibility or control
        over other parts and their associated contexts. The interdependencies between
        these activities, and among the relevant AI actors, can make it difficult
        to reliably anticipate impacts of AI systems. For example, early decisions
        in identifying purposes and objectives of an AI system can alter its behavior
        and capabilities, and the dynamics of deployment setting (such as end users
        or impacted individuals) can shape the impacts of AI system decisions. As
        a result, the best intentions within one dimension of the AI lifecycle can
        be undermined via interactions with decisions and conditions in other, later
        activities.

        This complexity and varying levels of visibility can introduce uncertainty
        into risk management practices. Anticipating, assessing, and otherwise addressing
        potential sources of negative risk can mitigate this uncertainty and enhance
        the integrity of the decision process.'
