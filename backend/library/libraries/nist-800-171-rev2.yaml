      description: 'Information flow control regulates where information can travel
        within a system and between systems (versus who can access the information)
        and without explicit regard to subsequent accesses to that information. Flow
        control restrictions include the following: keeping export-controlled information
        from being transmitted in the clear to the Internet; blocking outside traffic
        that claims to be from within the organization; restricting requests to the
        Internet that are not from the internal web proxy server; and limiting information
        transfers between organizations based on data structures and content.  Organizations
        commonly use information flow control policies and enforcement mechanisms
        to control the flow of information between designated sources and destinations
        (e.g., networks, individuals, and devices) within systems and between interconnected
        systems. Flow control is based on characteristics of the information or the
        information path. Enforcement occurs in boundary protection devices (e.g.,
        gateways, routers, guards, encrypted tunnels, firewalls) that employ rule
        sets or establish configuration settings that restrict system services, provide
        a packet-filtering capability based on header information, or message-filtering
        capability based on message content (e.g., implementing key word searches
        or using document characteristics). Organizations also consider the trustworthiness
        of filtering and inspection mechanisms (i.e., hardware, firmware, and software
        components) that are critical to information flow enforcement.  Transferring
        information between systems representing different security domains with different
        security policies introduces risk that such transfers violate one or more
        domain security policies. In such situations, information owners or stewards
        provide guidance at designated policy enforcement points between interconnected
        systems. Organizations consider mandating specific architectural solutions
        when required to enforce specific security policies. Enforcement includes:
        prohibiting information transfers between interconnected systems (i.e., allowing
        access only); employing hardware mechanisms to enforce one-way information
        flows; and implementing trustworthy regrading mechanisms to reassign security
        attributes and security labels.'

        Separation of duties includes dividing mission functions and system support
        functions among different individuals or roles; conducting system support
        functions with different individuals (e.g., configuration management, quality
        assurance and testing, system management, programming, and network security);
        and ensuring that security personnel administering access control functions
        do not also administer audit functions. Because separation of duty violations
        can span systems and application domains, organizations consider the entirety
        of organizational systems and system components when developing policy on
        separation of duties.

      description: Organizations employ the principle of least privilege for specific
        duties and authorized accesses for users and processes. The principle of least
        privilege is applied with the goal of authorized privileges no higher than
        necessary to accomplish required organizational missions or business functions.
        Organizations consider the creation of additional processes, roles, and system
        accounts as necessary, to achieve least privilege. Organizations also apply
        least privilege to the development, implementation, and operation of organizational
        systems. Security functions include establishing system accounts, setting
        events to be logged, setting intrusion detection parameters, and configuring
        access authorizations (i.e., permissions, privileges).  Privileged accounts,
        including super user accounts, are typically described as system administrator
        for various types of commercial off-the-shelf operating systems. Restricting
        privileged accounts to specific personnel or roles prevents day-to-day users
        from having access to privileged information or functions. Organizations may
        differentiate in the application of this requirement between allowed privileges
        for local accounts and for domain accounts provided organizations retain the
        ability to control system configurations for key security parameters and as
        otherwise necessary to sufficiently mitigate risk.

      description: Privileged functions include establishing system accounts, performing
        system integrity checks, conducting patching operations, or administering
        cryptographic key management activities. Non-privileged users are individuals
        that do not possess appropriate authorizations. Circumventing intrusion detection
        and prevention mechanisms or malicious code protection mechanisms are examples
        of privileged functions that require protection from non-privileged users.
        Note that this requirement represents a condition to be achieved by the definition
        of authorized privileges in 3.1.2.  Misuse of privileged functions, either
        intentionally or unintentionally by authorized users, or by unauthorized external
        entities that have compromised system accounts, is a serious and ongoing concern
        and can have significant adverse impacts on organizations. Logging the use
        of privileged functions is one way to detect such misuse, and in doing so,
        help mitigate the risk from insider threats and the advanced persistent threat.

      description: Remote access is access to organizational systems by users (or
        processes acting on behalf of users) communicating through external networks
        (e.g., the Internet). Remote access methods include dial-up, broadband, and
        wireless. Organizations often employ encrypted virtual private networks (VPNs)
        to enhance confidentiality over remote connections. The use of encrypted VPNs
        does not make the access non-remote; however, the use of VPNs, when adequately
        provisioned with appropriate control (e.g., employing encryption techniques
        for confidentiality protection), may provide sufficient assurance to the organization
        that it can effectively treat such connections as internal networks. VPNs
        with encrypted tunnels can affect the capability to adequately monitor network
        communications traffic for malicious code.  Automated monitoring and control
        of remote access sessions allows organizations to detect cyber-attacks and
        help to ensure ongoing compliance with remote access policies by auditing
        connection activities of remote users on a variety of system components (e.g.,
        servers, workstations, notebook computers, smart phones, and tablets).  [SP

      description: An event is any observable occurrence in a system, which includes
        unlawful or unauthorized system activity. Organizations identify event types
        for which a logging functionality is needed as those events which are significant
        and relevant to the security of systems and the environments in which those
        systems operate to meet specific and ongoing auditing needs. Event types can
        include password changes, failed logons or failed accesses related to systems,
        administrative privilege usage, or third-party credential usage. In determining
        event types that require logging, organizations consider the monitoring and
        auditing appropriate for each of the CUI security requirements. Monitoring
        and auditing requirements can be balanced with other system needs. For example,
        organizations may determine that systems must have the capability to log every
        file access both successful and unsuccessful, but not activate that capability
        except for specific circumstances due to the potential burden on system performance.  Audit
        records can be generated at various levels of abstraction, including at the
        packet level as information traverses the network. Selecting the appropriate
        level of abstraction is a critical aspect of an audit logging capability and
        can facilitate the identification of root causes to problems. Organizations
        consider in the definition of event types, the logging necessary to cover
        related events such as the steps in distributed, transaction-based processes
        (e.g., processes that are distributed across multiple organizations) and actions
        that occur in service-oriented or cloud-based architectures.  Audit record
        content that may be necessary to satisfy this requirement includes time stamps,
        source and destination addresses, user or process identifiers, event descriptions,
        success or fail indications, filenames involved, and access control or flow
        control rules invoked. Event outcomes can include indicators of event success
        or failure and event-specific results (e.g., the security state of the system
        after the event occurred).  Detailed information that organizations may consider
        in audit records includes full text recording of privileged commands or the
        individual identities of group account users. Organizations consider limiting
        the additional audit log information to only that information explicitly needed
        for specific audit requirements. This facilitates the use of audit trails
        and audit logs by not including information that could potentially be misleading
        or could make it more difficult to locate information of interest. Audit logs
        are reviewed and analyzed as often as needed to provide important information
        to organizations to facilitate risk-based decision making.  [SP 800-92] provides
        guidance on security log management.

      description: 'Organizations determine the required vulnerability scanning for
        all system components, ensuring that potential sources of vulnerabilities
        such as networked printers, scanners, and copiers are not overlooked. The
        vulnerabilities to be scanned are readily updated as new vulnerabilities are
        discovered, announced, and scanning methods developed. This process ensures
        that potential vulnerabilities in the system are identified and addressed
        as quickly as possible. Vulnerability analyses for custom software applications
        may require additional approaches such as static analysis, dynamic analysis,
        binary analysis, or a hybrid of the three approaches. Organizations can employ
        these analysis approaches in source code reviews and in a variety of tools
        (e.g., static analysis tools, web-based application scanners, binary analyzers)
        and in source code reviews. Vulnerability scanning includes: scanning for
        patch levels; scanning for functions, ports, protocols, and services that
        should not be accessible to users or devices; and scanning for improperly
        configured or incorrectly operating information flow control mechanisms.  To
        facilitate interoperability, organizations consider using products that are
        Security Content Automated Protocol (SCAP)-validated, scanning tools that
        express vulnerabilities in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)
        naming convention, and that employ the Open Vulnerability Assessment Language
        (OVAL) to determine the presence of system vulnerabilities. Sources for vulnerability
        information include the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) listing and the
        National Vulnerability Database (NVD).  Security assessments, such as red
        team exercises, provide additional sources of potential vulnerabilities for
        which to scan. Organizations also consider using scanning tools that express
        vulnerability impact by the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). In
        certain situations, the nature of the vulnerability scanning may be more intrusive
        or the system component that is the subject of the scanning may contain highly
        sensitive information. Privileged access authorization to selected system
        components facilitates thorough vulnerability scanning and protects the sensitive
        nature of such scanning. [SP 800-40] provides guidance on vulnerability management.'

        Organizations relying on commercial providers offering transmission services

        compensating safeguards or explicitly accept the additional risk. An example

        monitoring includes the observation of events occurring at the system boundary
        (i.e., part of perimeter defense and boundary protection). Internal monitoring
        includes the observation of events occurring within the system. Organizations
        can monitor systems, for example, by observing audit record activities in
        real time or by observing other system aspects such as access patterns, characteristics
        of access, and other actions. The monitoring objectives may guide determination
        of the events. System monitoring capability is achieved through a variety
        of tools and techniques (e.g., intrusion detection systems, intrusion prevention
        systems, malicious code protection software, scanning tools, audit record
        monitoring software, network monitoring software). Strategic locations for
        monitoring devices include selected perimeter locations and near server farms
        supporting critical applications, with such devices being employed at managed
        system interfaces. The granularity of monitoring information collected is
        based on organizational monitoring objectives and the capability of systems
        to support such objectives.  System monitoring is an integral part of continuous
        monitoring and incident response programs. Output from system monitoring serves
        as input to continuous monitoring and incident response programs. A network
        connection is any connection with a device that communicates through a network
        (e.g., local area network, Internet). A remote connection is any connection
        with a device communicating through an external network (e.g., the Internet).
        Local, network, and remote connections can be either wired or wireless.  Unusual
        or unauthorized activities or conditions related to inbound/outbound communications
        traffic include internal traffic that indicates the presence of malicious
        code in systems or propagating among system components, the unauthorized exporting
        of information, or signaling to external systems. Evidence of malicious code
        is used to identify potentially compromised systems or system components.
