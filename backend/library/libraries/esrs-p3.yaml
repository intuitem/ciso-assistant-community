        for employees, but it could equally signal workplace flexibility when offered
        as a voluntary choice. For this reason, the undertaking is required to disclose
        contextual information to help information users interpret the data. The undertaking
        can explain the reasons for temporary employment. An example of such a reason
        is the recruitment of employees to undertake work on a temporary or seasonal
        project or event. Another example is the standard practice of offering a temporary
        contract (for example, six months) to new employees before an offer of permanent
        employment is made. The undertaking may also explain the reasons for non-
        guaranteed hours employment.

      description: Impacts on value chain workers that originate in the strategy or

        in the context of a pandemic or other severe health crisis, undertakings that
        rely on contingent labour with little to no access to sick care and health
        benefits may face severe operational and business continuity risks as workers
        have no choice but to keep working while sick, further exacerbating the spread
        of the disease and causing major supply chain breakdowns. Another example
        is where selling goods premised on cheapest prices for customers create operational
        risks as suppliers under extreme price pressure may sub-contract production,
        leading to lower quality, and a longer, less transparent, and less controllable
        supply chain. Reputational and business opportunity risks linked to the exploitation
        of low-skilled, low-paid workers in sourcing geographies with minimal protections
        for them are also increasing with media backlash and consumer preferences
        moving to more ethically sourced or sustainable goods.
