      description: "Introduction:\nThe requirements derived from the information security\
        \ strategy and the context of the organization result in information security\
        \ guidelines, which can be mapped in a multi-level document pyramid depending\
        \ on the size of the company. The context of the organization results, among\
        \ other things, from the corporate culture, customer requirements or legal\
        \ requirements. An overarching guideline is usually the main document on the\
        \ basis of which further guidelines and regulations are derived.\n\nJustification:\n\
        Guidelines and regulations are the basis for joint action to achieve strategic\
        \ corporate goals. Without central regulations that are visible to relevant\
        \ persons, misunderstandings can arise from the point of view of information\
        \ security and different decisions can be made, which consequently generate\
        \ incalculable risks to information security. In addition, regulations are\
        \ a basis for comparing the actual implementation with the written requirements\
        \ in regular effectiveness checks and for identifying opportunities for improvement.\
        \ \n\nBasic information:\nIt is important to consider the requirements of\
        \ information security in business processes.  Requirements for information\
        \ security means the level of security that ensures the safe handling of information.\n\
        The requirements can be brought to the organization from outside or arise\
        \ from within the organization itself. \nThe requirements of the individual\
        \ \"interested parties\" must be aligned with the objectives of the organization\
        \ and a strategy must be identified to achieve the requirements and objectives.\n\
        \nEmployees will also find detailed explanations of the consequences of non-compliance\
        \ with guidelines in the guidelines.  \nThe organization examines from its\
        \ point of view the need for guidelines for achieving the objectives and for\
        \ operating an ISMS and creates them. \nSince framework conditions can change,\
        \ it makes sense to check the guidelines regularly, e.g. annually, for appropriateness\
        \ and correctness.\nEmployees need access to the policies. A central location,\
        \ such as the intranet, is recommended to ensure that you always have access\
        \ to the latest version of a policy. This is where printed guidelines have\
        \ significant disadvantages. \nA business partner may also need access to\
        \ the guidelines, for example, because he assigns or transfers personnel within\
        \ the scope of the ISMS. The need for contractual arrangements will be assessed\
        \ by the organisation.\n\n\"Other relevant security policies\" designates\
        \ all security-relevant policies that are not part of the ISMS and are relevant\
        \ for Information Security."

        \ for confidentiality, integrity and availability.\nOn this basis, an organization\
        \ can determine fundamental protective measures to protect itself and the\
        \ information assets/carriers.\n\nBasic requirements:\nInformation assets,\
        \ information carriers and protection requirements change regularly (e.g.\
        \ in the event of changes to the organisation, the IT landscape or processes).\
        \ One task of the organization is to keep the directory of identified information\
        \ assets and information carriers up to date. A central process is helpful\
        \ in order to obtain a complete overview of these assets along the entire\
        \ life cycle from generation/commissioning, use to destruction/deletion. Overviews\
        \ of these information assets and information carriers as well as the protection\
        \ requirements are a supporting instrument in order to obtain and maintain\
        \ a comprehensive overview.\nFor a comprehensive analysis of these information\
        \ assets, a look at the essential business processes and the information assets\
        \ processed in this process helps, since the protection requirements also\
        \ depend on the process. In a further step, further information is relevant,\
        \ the loss or disclosure of which would cause financial or reputational damage\
        \ (e.g. patents, business documents, customer lists, customer contracts, personnel\
        \ files, etc.).\n\nAssets where security is of relevance are all assets where\
        \ information or cyber security threats have relevant impact to the organization\
        \ or its business. This includes IT systems, IT services, OT systems, IOT\
        \ devices."

      description: 'Introduction:

        The objective of the classification of information assets is a consistent
        determination of the need for protection. This allows the organization to
        standardize and apply appropriate security measures. The classification of
        information is based on the upstream determination of the possible information
        assets and information carriers, which is described in more detail in Control
        1.3.1.


        Justification:

        The unambiguous classification of information assets and the description of
        standardized and specified protective measures for handling information significantly
        reduces the scope for handling information assets. In this way, concrete guidelines
        help both the owners, users and additional departments such as IT to handle
        the information assets appropriately.'

      description: "Software determines the logic on how information is processed\
        \ within the organization. A short and pragmatic approval helps to ensure\
        \ that software does not generate irresponsible risks to the organization's\
        \ information and infrastructure.\n\nEvaluation and approval of software enables\
        \ the organization to limit risks of unintended logic and at the same time\
        \ is the basis of a solid vulnerability and patch management (see 5.2.5) as\
        \ well as maintaining a compliant license management (see 7.1.1). Its important\
        \ to also consider software for admin and maintenance use such as debugging\
        \ and firmware updating tools. \nWhen it comes to software management, the\
        \ first step should be to determine on which level software needs to be approved.\
        \ Finding a good compromise between the need for security and practicallity\
        \ is the main driver of this consideration. For example, dedicated approval\
        \ of every application or software library that comes with the base installation\
        \ of the operating system would be excessive in many scenarios. Similarly,\
        \ the commitment to a specific device usually means that not approving necessary\
        \ firmware and/or device drivers significantly impacts the devices usability.\n\
        A repository of approved software prevents that people inside your organization\
        \ accidentally install unapproved or modified software. Maintaining software\
        \ versions and patch levels simplifies patch-management, but does not necessarily\
        \ mean that every patch needs to be individually evaluated before approval.\
        \ \nEspecially if you have software that allows you to conduct administrative\
        \ tasks, additional requirements might be necessary. A tool allowing to monitor\
        \ network traffic for security or debugging purposes or manipulate configuration\
        \ of critical system might be restricted for use requiring individual approval\
        \ while maintaining a 4-eyes principile.\n\nKey is to keep the evaluation\
        \ and approval processes simple enough to be practical. If approval becomes\
        \ to difficult or time-consuming, your administration will become reluctant\
        \ to approve relevant software and users in the organization will circumvent\
        \ the appvoal process to get the software they need. Accordingly, a good evaluation\
        \ process is  designed, to adapt to the protection need of the software. This\
        \ means first of all, to decide on the level of evaluation necessary for specific\
        \ classes of software.\n\nWhen it comes to evaluation, the control already\
        \ gives good indications what steps the evaluation processes should follow:\n\
        + Determine the intended or forseeable use scenario of the software and what\
        \ security requirements apply for that scenario (i.e. is the approval including\
        \ special high risk scenarios with specific security requirements or is the\
        \ approval for normal risk use cases with a limited set of security requirements\
        \ only)\n+ Determine if your organization has the right to use the software\
        \ (i.e. does the (to be) acquired licensing permit the intended use-case)\n\
        + Consider the source of the software. Do your organization trusts the source\
        \ (e.g. is it provided or distributed by a known and trusted software vendor)\n\
        \nThe outcome of these three steps will determine additional evaluation need.\
        \ When deciding on further steps, keep in mind that further testing or evaluation\
        \ might not only remidiate risks, but also creates a time delay which can\
        \ be a risk in itself. For example, in many cases the risk of not installing\
        \ a security relevant patch because testing has not been conducted11 yet is\
        \ higher than the risk that the patch creates issues that would have been\
        \ detected by testing. A good approach always aims to find an appropriate\
        \ balance.\n\nAccordingly, granularity of software approval vary by scenario\
        \ and can be very broad. For example, it might be practical to approve all\
        \ system software that comes with a baseline operating system installation\
        \ (i.e. operating system components, drivers, etc.). Also approval of trusted\
        \ software repositories (i.e. based on the app classification of a mobile\
        \ device store or operating system distribution) can be a valid approach,\
        \ especially when limited to use in standard scenarios (i.e. without access\
        \ to information with a significant protection need) \n \nWhen it comes to\
        \ the type of approval, its important to notice that there is no need to keep\
        \ centrallized approval lists. Based of the organization, the approval can\
        \ be done in a decentralized way (i.e. in some cases, the development department\
        \ has its specific evaluation and approval capabilities within the framework\
        \ of the centralized processes). Similarly, its often more pratical and accurate\
        \ to maintain an overview over installed software versions and patch levels\
        \ by automated management tools rather than by manually maintaining lists. "

        \ different physical areas with different protection requirements. How a corresponding\
        \ zone is to be protected is derived from the protection requirements of the\
        \ assets located there. The more important the assets located there, the higher\
        \ the protection requirements of the security zone.\nFor example, personnel\
        \ data or prototype data and the areas in which they are processed are more\
        \ sensitive than areas of the canteen where menus are displayed.\nIn principle,\
        \ each company can freely choose the number of existing zone types. One approach\
        \ would be, for example, to link the classification levels \"public\" to,\
        \ for example, \"strictly confidential\" and the analogous definition of 4\
        \ security zones.\n\nBasic information:\nAn effective security zone concept\

        \ measures. These separations can be represented by the following measures,\
        \ among others:\n- Technical measures such as detectors and alarm monitoring.\n\
        - Physical measures such as the use of walls, doors, locking systems\n- Personnel\
        \ measures such as security guards, doormen, receptionists\n- Organizational\
        \ measures such as processes for granting and withdrawing access authorizations.\n\
        Only if a zone is separated from the previous zones by one or more measures,\
        \ it can be considered as an independent zone. If there is no protective measure\
        \ between the respective security zones, the higher security zone falls back\
        \ to the lower zone.\nUsing the example of an open-plan office, it is not\
        \ possible to define one part as a highly sensitive zone for handling strictly\
        \ confidential data, for example, and the other part as an internal zone.\n\
        Using the example of a server room, this falls back to the protection level\
        \ of the existing area such as corridors if the doors to the server room are\
        \ not locked and no monitoring takes place.\n\nSecurity zones should be built\
        \ on the basis of an onion-shell model. A highly protected zone is usually\
        \ not adjacent to a public area (e.g. The prototype warehouse is located directly\
        \ next to the publicly accessible canteen). Ideally, between a public area\
        \ and a highly sensitive area such as the prototype warehouse, there is an\
        \ \"internal\" zone as a buffer, which only the company's own employees can\
        \ enter.\nA direct derivation of protective measures from the security zones\
        \ is the implementation of the need-to-know principle. The more security-relevant\
        \ the security zone, the fewer people should be able to enter the area. For\
        \ example, if the entire workforce can enter an open-plan office, only administrators\
        \ usually need access authorizations for the server room. For the implementation\
        \ of a security zone concept, the implementation of an access concept is therefore\
        \ always necessary. However, it should be noted that locking concepts do not\
        \ correspond 1-to-1 with the security zones, since, for example, a prototype\
        \ responsible for the highly sensitive zone of the prototype protection may\
        \ not enter the highly sensitive zone of the server room, or the administrator\
        \ does not necessarily have to enter prototype areas.\n\nThe definition of\
        \ security zones can affect the following areas, among others: \n- Technical\
        \ measures: use of alarm systems, motion detectors, video cameras + Physical\
        \ measures: walls, barbed wire, fences, resistance classes of doors & windows\n\
        - Personnel measures: use of doormen, security services with stripes, use\
        \ of external service providers such as cleaning companies\n- Organizational\
        \ measures: Allocation of access authorizations (need-to-know), frequency\
        \ of rights review of access authorizations; the introduction of sound recording\
        \ devices; masking of optics from smartphones of employees and employees;\
        \ Clear Screen and Clean Desk requirements; visitor registration requirements;\
        \ Conclusion of confidentiality agreements (GHV); Use or prohibition of smart\
        \ devices (e.g. with microphones)\n#####Technik with organizational measures#####\n\
        \nDesign aids for defining security zones in the security zone concept:\n\
        The use of a zone scheme based on the classification scheme with four zone\
        \ types has established itself as good practice for security zones: public\
        \ area, normal protection area, high protection area and very high protection\
        \ area. It is easier to transfer the protection requirements of the assets\
        \ into a zone scheme, especially when first sketching security zones.\nIt\
        \ has also proven to be useful to mark the security zones on premises and\
        \ building floor plans in color in order to provide the company itself and\
        \ possible auditors with a quick overview of the location of the security\
        \ zones. One possibility is the use of clearly defined and intuitive colors\
        \ for each security zone. For example, the following color scheme could be\
        \ chosen:\n + Gray colors = Public areas \n + Green Colors = Internal Areas\n\
        \ + Yellow colors = Areas with high protection needs (e.g. Confidential)\n\
        \ + Red colors = Areas with very high protection needs (e.g. Strictly Confidential)"

      description: "Introduction:\nThe term \"supporting asset\" refers to all media\
        \ on which information can be permanently stored. These include fixed IT devices\
        \ (e.g. workstation PCs, workstations, servers, etc.), mobile IT devices (e.g.\
        \ USB sticks, memory cards, notebooks, smartphones, etc.) as well as analogue\
        \ media such as paper documents. For all supporting assets, information security\
        \ and thus a secure application from creation to use to disposal is of fundamental\
        \ importance. \n\nJustification:\nDuring the entire life cycle of supporting\
        \ assets, there is a risk that sensitive information, e.g. If the data is\
        \ not adequately protected, it can be lost and/or spied on. Therefore, supporting\
        \ assets are to be protected according to the need for protection of the information\
        \ stored or processed on them.\n\nBasic information:\nBefore the creation\
        \ phase, therefore, the question of the need for protection and the associated\
        \ classification of the supporting assets already arises. These are usually\
        \ dependent on the information information assets that are stored on them\
        \ (see Control 1.3.1 and 1.3.2). Based on the need for protection under the\
        \ classification, appropriate protective measures for the creation, use and\
        \ disposal of the supporting assets can then be defined and implemented."

      description: "Introduction:\nThe basic objective of this control is to continuously\
        \ deal with current vulnerabilities in IT systems of any kind in order to\
        \ mitigate known gaps as quickly as possible before they can be exploited.\
        \ \n\nJustification:\nAttackers can exploit vulnerabilities in IT systems,\
        \ for example, to gain access to the network and thus to information carriers\
        \ and information assets. Vulnerability detection therefore plays a central\
        \ role in information security. It is the basis for the necessary vulnerability\
        \ management and thus also for the following risk analyses and derivation\
        \ of measures.\n\nBasic information:\nSince exploited vulnerabilities can\
        \ have extremely far-reaching effects, especially if the attack is not detected\
        \ at all (e.g. \"listening\" without direct damage), a systematic approach\
        \ makes sense. It is important to obtain as much information as possible about\
        \ the IT systems used in your own organization and external systems, such\
        \ as:\n- Operating Systems\n- Firmware\n- Apps\n- Cloud Services \n\nAn ISMS\
        \ can generally play to its strengths here. Controls that can help here are,\
        \ for example:\n- Defining responsibilities (see 1.2.2 and 1.2.4)\n- Identify\
        \ relevant systems (cf.1.3.1)\n- Identify risks (see 1.4.1)\n- Training and\
        \ sensitizing employees (see 2.1.3)\n- Preparation for exceptional situations\
        \ (see 3.1.2)\n- Change Management (see 5.2.1)\n- Review of information systems\

      description: "Within the context of ISA, the term contractor includes both classic\
        \ suppliers and subcontractors but also classic service providers, freelancers\
        \ or other partner companies. It also includes cooperation partners (e.g.\
        \ academic institutions, institutes).\n\nThe explanations below describe a\
        \ possible procedure for fulfilling the requirements:\n\nIdentification of\
        \ contractors and specification of protection needs and security requirements:\n\
        At first, all contractors must be identified (e.g. via the list of creditors\
        \ of the accountants department) in order to gain an initial overview. \n\
        For all contractors, the respective protection needs should be specified and\
        \ the security requirements derived according to their tasks and the relevance\
        \ to own and customer\u2019s processes. \nGenerally, a large number of contractors\
        \ is found not to require the assignment of relevant protection needs and\
        \ to be therefore not subject to security requirements (e.g. suppliers of\
        \ office stationary). \n\nEnsuring implementation by the contractor:\nIn the\
        \ next step, the applicable requirements must be made known to all security-relevant\
        \ contractors in a suitable manner and (contractually) fixed as being mandatory.\
        \ Finally, a decision should be made as to how the implementation of the security\
        \ requirements can be appropriately verified. For this purpose, adequate verification\
        \ processes and procedures should be defined according to the respective risk\
        \ (and the associated protection needs). Their purpose is to ensure that contractors\
        \ implement the necessary requirements.\n\nEstablishment in standard processes:\n\
        The insights gained should be used to develop a comprehensible procedure and\
        \ to integrate it into the existing processes of the B2B\_/ supplier management.\
        \ This starts with the selection of the contractor, where aspects of information\
        \ security should already be considered alongside criteria such as quality,\
        \ adherence to delivery dates, credit rating etc. The procurement process\
        \ should be such that the relevance of information security has already been\
        \ considered beforehand (with respect to the procurement decision; contract\
        \ design; inspection requirements).\nFurthermore, it is recommended to incorporate\
        \ information security aspects into existing processes for supplier evaluation\
        \ which have already been established by e.g. an existing quality management\
        \ system.\nContractually specified deliverables (e.g. availability requirements)\
        \ should be verified at regular intervals. This can be done by e.g. regular\
        \ analysis of service reports and SLAs.  "

      description: "Introduction: \n\nLaws, regulations as well as standards, contracts\
        \ or even specially imposed requirements can result in requirements for processes,\
        \ infrastructure, projects and / or workflows. Some of these requirements\
        \ relate specifically to information security. Control therefore helps to\
        \ identify and understand the existing requirements and to regulate the handling\
        \ to meet the requirements. \nReason:\nThe risks arising from non-compliance\
        \ with specifications can result in serious financial and material damage\
        \ as well as reputation-damaging consequences in one's own company or with\
        \ customers and business partners. If requirements and specifications are\
        \ not complied with or are not determined, this may result in breaches of\
        \ contract or laws with corresponding consequences or risks for the company\
        \ and its business partners.\nBasic information: \nIm general, Control is\
        \ concerned with determining and monitoring compliance with requirements arising\
        \ from laws, regulations and contracts as well as self-imposed requirements.\
        \ The focus is on the relevance to the ISMS. It can be helpful here to first\
        \ identify all relevant requirements, check them regularly and collect them\
        \ in a kind of legal cadastre. In addition, it is necessary to define, in\
        \ accordance with the requirements, how the corresponding provisions are to\
        \ be fulfilled and for which group of persons these provisions are relevant.\
        \ This can be done, for example, in the context of guidelines, action plans\
        \ or work instructions that have been made known to the corresponding responsible\
        \ persons.\nIf requirements arise with regard to the integrity of documents\
        \ and records, such as protection against loss, retention periods or access\
        \ authorizations, these must also be recorded and considered."
