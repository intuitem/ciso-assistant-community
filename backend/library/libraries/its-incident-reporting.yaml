      description: In order to ensure consistent reporting of major incidents and
        submission of good quality data, it should be specified which data fields
        need to be provided by financial entities at various stages of the reporting,
        when providing initial notification, inter- mediate and final reports as referred
        to in Article 19(4) of Regulation (EU) 2024/25542 . It is important that information
        provided over the different reporting stages until the final report is presented
        in a way that allows for a single overview. Therefore, there should be a single
        template which covers all necessary information throughout the reporting stages
        that should be used for the submission of the initial notification, the intermediate
        and final report.

        are required to provide at a later reporting stage, i.e. the intermediate
        or final report as relevant, they should be allowed to anticipate that data
        and complete those data fields and provide to the com- petent authorities.
