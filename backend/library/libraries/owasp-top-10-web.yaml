      name: Broken Access Control
      description:
        Access control enforces policy such that users cannot act outside
        of their intended permissions. Failures typically lead to unauthorized information
        disclosure, modification, or destruction of all data or performing a business
        function outside the user's limits.

      name: Cryptographic Failures
      description:
        The first thing is to determine the protection needs of data in transit
        and at rest. For example, passwords, credit card numbers, health records, personal
        information, and business secrets require extra protection, mainly if that data
        falls under privacy laws, e.g., EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR),
        or regulations, e.g., financial data protection such as PCI Data Security Standard
        (PCI DSS).

      name: Injection
      description:
        "An application is vulnerable to attack when: User-supplied data
        is not validated, filtered, or sanitized by the application / Dynamic queries
        or non-parameterized calls without context-aware escaping are used directly
        in the interpreter / Hostile data is used within object-relational mapping (ORM)
        search parameters to extract additional, sensitive records / Hostile data is
        directly used or concatenated. The SQL or command contains the structure and
        malicious data in dynamic queries, commands, or stored procedures."

      description:
        Insecure design is a broad category representing different weaknesses,
        expressed as missing or ineffective control design.

      name: Security Misconfiguration
      description:
        "The application might be vulnerable if the application is: Missing
        appropriate security hardening across any part of the application stack or improperly
        configured permissions on cloud services. / Unnecessary features are enabled
        or installed (e.g., unnecessary ports, services, pages, accounts, or privileges).
        / Default accounts and their passwords are still enabled and unchanged. / Error
        handling reveals stack traces or other overly informative error messages to
        users. / For upgraded systems, the latest security features are disabled or
        not configured securely. / The security settings in the application servers,
        application frameworks (e.g., Struts, Spring, ASP.NET), libraries, databases,
        etc., are not set to secure values. / The server does not send security headers
        or directives, or they are not set to secure values. / The software is out of
        date or vulnerable"
    - urn: urn:intuitem:risk:threat:A06
      ref_id: A06
      name: Vulnerable and Outdated Components
      description:
        "You are likely vulnerable: If you do not know the versions of all
        components you use (both client-side and server-side). This includes components
        you directly use as well as nested dependencies. / If the software is vulnerable,
        unsupported, or out of date. This includes the OS, web/application server, database
        management system (DBMS), applications, APIs and all components, runtime environments,
        and libraries. / If you do not scan for vulnerabilities regularly and subscribe
        to security bulletins related to the components you use. / If you do not fix
        or upgrade the underlying platform, frameworks, and dependencies in a risk-based,
        timely fashion. This commonly happens in environments when patching is a monthly
        or quarterly task under change control, leaving organizations open to days or
        months of unnecessary exposure to fixed vulnerabilities. / If software developers
        do not test the compatibility of updated, upgraded, or patched libraries. /
        If you do not secure the components’ configurations"

      name: Identification and Authentication Failures
      description:
        Confirmation of the user's identity, authentication, and session
        management is critical to protect against authentication-related attacks.
    - urn: urn:intuitem:risk:threat:A08
      ref_id: A08
      name: Software and Data Integrity Failures
      description:
        Software and data integrity failures relate to code and infrastructure
        that does not protect against integrity violations. An example of this is where
        an application relies upon plugins, libraries, or modules from untrusted sources,
        repositories, and content delivery networks (CDNs). An insecure CI/CD pipeline
        can introduce the potential for unauthorized access, malicious code, or system
        compromise. Lastly, many applications now include auto-update functionality,
        where updates are downloaded without sufficient integrity verification and applied
        to the previously trusted application. Attackers could potentially upload their
        own updates to be distributed and run on all installations. Another example
        is where objects or data are encoded or serialized into a structure that an
        attacker can see and modify is vulnerable to insecure deserialization.

      name: "Security Logging and Monitoring Failures "
      description:
        Returning to the OWASP Top 10 2021, this category is to help detect,
        escalate, and respond to active breaches. Without logging and monitoring, breaches
        cannot be detected.

      ref_id: A10
      name: "Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) "
      description:
        SSRF flaws occur whenever a web application is fetching a remote
        resource without validating the user-supplied URL. It allows an attacker to
        coerce the application to send a crafted request to an unexpected destination,
        even when protected by a firewall, VPN, or another type of network access control
        list (ACL). As modern web applications provide end-users with convenient features,
        fetching a URL becomes a common scenario. As a result, the incidence of SSRF
        is increasing. Also, the severity of SSRF is becoming higher due to cloud services
        and the complexity of architectures.
