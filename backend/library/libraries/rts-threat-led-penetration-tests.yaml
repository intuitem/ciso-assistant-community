        justified. Hence, authorities responsible for TLPT matters (TLPT authorities,
        either at national or Union level) should exclude from the scope of TLPT those
        financial entities operating in core financial services subsectors for which
        a TLPT is not justified. It means that credit institutions, payment and electronic
        money institutions, central security depositories, central counterparties,
        trading venues, insurance and reinsurance undertakings, even though when meeting
        the quantitative criteria identified in this Regulation, could be opted out
        of the TLPT scope in light of an overall assessment of their ICT risk profile

        other than credit institutions, payment institutions, electronic money institutions,
        central counterparties, central securities depositories, trading venues, insurance
        and reinsurance undertakings should be subject to TLPT. The assessment of
        the abovementioned qualitative elements should aim at identifying financial
        entities for which the TLPT is appropriate by using cross-sector and objective
        indicators. At the same time, the assessment of these elements should limit
        the entities subject to TLPT to those for which the test is justified. These
        elements should also be assessed with reference to new market participants
        (such as crypto asset service providers referred to in Title V of Regulation
        (EU) 2023/1114) which might have a more important role for the financial sector
        in the future.

      description: In order to ensure that the TLPT benefits from the experience developed
        in the framework of TIBER-EU implementation and to reduce the risks associated
        to the performance of TLPT, it should be ensured that the responsibilities
        of the TLPT cyber teams to be set up at the level of TLPT authorities match
        as closely as possible those of the TIBER cyber teams under TIBER-EU. Hence,
        the TLPT cyber teams should include test managers responsible for overseeing
        the individual TLPTs and be responsible for planning and coordination of individual
        tests. TLPT cyber teams should serve as single point of contact for test-related
        communication to internal and external stakeholders, collect and process feedback
        and lessons learned from previously conducted tests and provide support to
        financial entities undergoing TLPT testing.

        proposals. Building on the experience under the TIBER-EU framework, it has
        proven to be valuable to have a team of at least two test managers assigned
        to each test. To reflect that the TLPT is used to encourage the learning experience,
        to safeguard the confidentiality of tests, and unless they have resources
        or expertise issues, TLPT authorities are strongly encouraged to consider
        that, for the duration of a TLPT, test managers should not conduct supervisory
        activities on the same financial entity undergoing a TLPT.

      description: ' It is important, for consistency with the TIBER-EU framework,
        that the TLPT authority closely follows the test in each of its stages. Considering
        the nature of the test and the risks associated to it, it is fundamental that
        the approach to be followed for each specific phase of the testing refers,
        where relevant, to the role of the TLPT authority. In particular, the TLPT
        authority should be consulted and should validate those assessments or decisions
        of the financial entities that may, on the one hand, have an effect on the
        effectiveness of the test and, on the other hand, have an impact on the risks
        associated with the test. Examples of the fundamental steps on which a specific
        involvement of the TLPT authority is necessary include the validation of certain
        fundamental documentation of the test, the selection of threat intelligence
        providers and testers and risk management measures. The involvement of the
        TLPT authority, with particular reference to validations, should not result
        in an excessive burden for the authorities and should therefore be limited
        to those documentation and decisions directly affecting the positive outcome
        of the TLPT. The involvement of the TLPT authority as described in this Regulation
        is also necessary for the purposes of the issuance of the attestation pursuant
        to Article 26(7) of Regulation (EU) 2022/2554. Through the active participation
        to each phase of the testing the TLPT authorities may effectively assess compliance
        of the financial entities with the relevant requirements.'

      description: The secrecy of a TLPT is of utmost importance to ensure that the
        conditions of the test are realistic, therefore, testing should be covert,
        and precautions should be taken in order to keep the TLPT confidential, including
        the choice of codenames designed in such a way as not allowing the identification
        of the TLPT by third parties. Should staff members responsible for the security
        of the financial team be aware of a planned or ongoing TLPT, it is likely
        that they would be more observant and alert than during normal working conditions,
        thereby resulting in an altered outcome of the test. Therefore, staff members
        of the financial entity outside of the control team should be made aware of
        any planned or ongoing TLPT only in presence of cogent reasons and subject
        to prior agreement of the test managers. This may for example be to ensure
        the secrecy of the test in case a blue team member has detected the test.

      description: Intelligence-led red team tests differ from conventional penetration
        tests, which provide a detailed and useful assessment of technical and configuration
        vulnerabilities often of a single system or environment in isolation, but
        contrary to the former, do not assess the full scenario of a targeted attack
        against an entire entity, including the complete scope of its people, processes
        and technologies. During the selection process, financial entities should
        ensure that testers possess the requisite skills to perform intelligence-led
        red team tests, and not only penetration tests. This Regulation establishes
        comprehensive criteria for testers, both internal and external, and threat
        intelligence providers, always external. In case the threat intelligence provider
        and the external testers are part of the same company, the staff assigned
        to the test should be adequately separated. Acknowledging the evolving state
        of this market, there may be exceptional circumstances where financial entities
        are unable to secure suitable providers who meet these standards. Therefore,
        financial entities, upon evidencing the unavailability of fully compliant
        and suitable providers, should be permitted to engage those who do not satisfy
        all criteria, conditional upon the proper mitigation of any resultant additional
        risks and to an assessment of all these elements by TLPT authority.

        the designated financial entity, and namely that it should be in charge of
        providing all necessary documentation to the lead TLPT authority and monitoring
        the test process. The designated financial entity should also be in charge

        role of the designated financial entity, the obligations of each financial
        entity participating to the pooled TLPT process remain unaffected during the
        pooled test. The same principle is valid for joint TLPTs.

        in order to learn from the testing experience in collaboration with the testers.
        For this purpose and to allow for adequate preparation, the red team test
        report and the blue team test report should be made available to all parties
        involved in the replay activities, prior to conducting any replay activities.

        out to maximize the learning experience. Methods that may be used for purple
        teaming in the closure phase include discussions of alternative attack scenarios,
        exploration on live systems of alternative scenarios or the re-exploration
        of planned scenarios on live systems that the testers had been unable to complete
