        from around the world. Some were written by GLI; others were written by industry
        regulators with input from independent test laboratories and Event Wagering
        System operators, developers, and suppliers. GLI has taken each of the standards
        documents and merged the unique rules, eliminated some rules and updated others,
        to reflect both the change in technology and the purpose of maintaining an
        objective standard that achieves common regulatory objectives without unnecessarily
        impeding technological innovation. GLI lists below, and gives credit to, agencies
        whose documents were reviewed prior to writing this Standard. It is the policy
        of GLI to update this document as often as warranted to reflect changes in
        technology and/or testing methods. This document will be distributed without

        to ensure that the system is configured and operated with the necessary level
        of security and control. To that end, it is expected that the operator will
        establish a set of Minimum Internal Control Standards (MICS) to define the
        internal processes for the creation, management, and handling of wagering
        transactions as well as the requirements for internal control of any system
        or component software and hardware, and their associated accounts.

        in a way that is general in nature and does not limit or authorize specific
        events, markets or types of wagers. The intent is to provide a framework to
        cover those currently known and permitted by law. This document is not intended

        technical standard. It is the responsibility of the stakeholders of each operator
        to determine how to best meet the requirements laid out in this document.
