        complete. In case the application submitted is not complete, the relevant
        ESA should reject the application and request the missing information.

      description: Once the recommendations to a critical ICT third-party service
        provider are issued by the Lead Overseer, and competent authorities have informed
        the relevant financial entities of the risks identified in that recommendations,
        the Lead Overseer should monitor and assess the implementation by the critical
        ICT third-party service provider of the actions and remedies to comply with
        the recommendations. Competent authorities should monitor and assess the extent
        to which the financial entities are exposed to the risks identified in these
        recommendations. With a view to maintain a level playing field while carrying
        out their respective tasks, particularly when the risks identified in the
        recommendations are severe and shared among a large number of financial entities
        in multiple Member States, both the competent authorities and the Lead Overseer
        should share among each other relevant findings which are necessary for them
        to carry out their respective tasks. The objective of the information sharing
        is to ensure that the feedback of the Lead Overseer to the critical ICT third-party
        provider in relation to the actions and remedies the latter is implementing
        takes into account the impact on the risks of the financial entities, and
        that the supervisory activities performed by the competent authorities are
        informed by the assessment carried out by the Lead Overseer.

        the extent to which the financial entities supervised by them are exposed

        carried out in a proportionate and risk-based manner. Lead Overseer should
        request the competent authorities to share the results of this assessment
        in the specific cases when the risks associated with the recommendations are
        severe and shared among a large number of financial entities in multiple Member
        States. To make the best use of the resources of the competent authorities,
        when asking to provide the results of this assessment, the Lead Overseer should
        always take into account that the objective of these requests is to evaluate
        the actions and remedies of the critical ICT third-party providers.
