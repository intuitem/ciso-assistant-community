        guidelines also specify a common template for the submission of the aggregated

      description: Financial entities should estimate the aggregate annual costs and
        losses of major ICT-related incidents by aggregating the costs and losses
        for major ICT-related incidents that fall within the reference year for which
        the competent authority requested the estimation. The financial entity may
        choose whether the reference year should correspond to either the completed
        calendar year, or to the completed accounting year of the financial entity
        for which the financial entity has finalised its financial statements. Once
        a financial entity has decided whether it will provide the estimation based
        on the calendar year or its accounting year, such a decision should be applied
        to future estimations of aggregated annual costs and losses. The financial
        entity may change that decision by notifying the competent authority, and
        provided that the competent authority does not object within two months of
        receiving the notification. Financial entities should not include costs and
        losses related to those incidents that fall before or after that reference
        year.
