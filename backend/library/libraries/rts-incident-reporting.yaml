      description: Given that Regulation (EU) 2022/2554 aims to harmonise and streamline
        incident reporting requirements, and to ensure that competent and other relveant
        authorities receive all necessary information about the major incident in
        order to take supervisory actions and to prevent potential spill-over effects,
        the reports for major incidents submitted from financial entities to competent
        authorities should provide essential and exhaustive information about the
        incident, in a consistent and standardised manner for all financial entities
        within the scope of Regulation (EU) 2022/2554.

        2022/2555, the time limits for reporting major incidents should be consistent
        for all types of financial entities. The time limits should also be consistent
        with, to the greatest extent possible, and at least equivalent in effect to
        the requirements set out in Directive (EU) 2022/2555.

      description: In order to take proper action, competent authorities need to receive
        information about the major incident at the very early stages after the incident
        has been classified as major. Consequently, the timeline for submitting the
        initial notification should be as short as possible after classification of
        the incident but also providing flexibility for financial entities, especially
        for non-time critical service business models, with a longer timeline after
        financial entities become aware of the incident in case financial entities
        require more time to handle the incident. To avoid imposing an undue reporting
        burden to the financial entity at a time when it will be handling with the
        incident, the content of such initial notification should be limited to the
        most significant information.

        intermediate report and the full set of relevant information with the final
        report to further assess the situation and evaluate supervisory actions they
        may want to take, the reporting timelines should be such to allow competent
        authorities to receive the information timely, while ensuring financial entities
        have sufficient time to obtain complete and accurate information.
