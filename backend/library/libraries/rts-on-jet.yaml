      description: After the designation of the critical information and communication
        technology (ICT) third-party service providers and taking into account the
        annual oversight plans for all critical ICT third-party service providers,
        the authorities listed in Article 40(2) of Regulation (EU) 2022/2554 should
        be asked to nominate their staff as member of the joint examination teams.
        These authorities should ensure that the nominated staff meet the specific
        technical expertise required in the profiles needed in the joint examination
        teams. The demonstration that an authority does not have staff meeting the
        specific technical expertise needed in the joint examination teams should
        be considered by the Lead Overseer as justification to discharge, at that
        point in time, the authorities of their obligation to nominate staff members
        to the joint examination teams. In that case, the authority should nevertheless
        commit on the best effort basis to address this shortfall of expertise and
        try to reinforce its capabilities to contribute to the joint examination teams
        in the context of the next exercise. The staff members designated as members
        of a joint examination team should continue to be employees of the nominating
        authority and therefore subject to working hours and permanent location of
        work as included in their employment contracts.

      description: In order to ensure the most effective use of resources in the execution
        of oversight activities, a joint examination team should be able to oversee
        multiple critical ICT third- party service providers. The grouping of the
        critical ICT third-party service providers to be assigned to a specific joint
        examination team, and its overall staffing needs should take into account
        the risk profile of the critical ICT third-party service providers, and the
        envisaged level of intensity of oversight activities. This should result in
        a strategic multi-annual oversight plan, updated annually by the Lead Overseer
        to the extent necessary, and reflected into the individual annual oversight
        plan. To ensure the reliability of the planned and ongoing commitment of resource
        staffing of the joint examination teams by the nominating authorities, the
        Lead Overseer should consult both the joint oversight network and the Oversight
        Forum.

      description: The Lead Overseer should apply a combination of criteria and principles
        when identifying the number of staff members in each joint examination team
        and the resulting composition. Those criteria and principles should take into
        account the technical nature of the oversight tasks, the different grade of
        dependency of financial entities on the services provided by the critical
        ICT third-party service providers, the geographical distribution, the size
        and the number of financial entities relying on those services and, where
        possible, a proportionate cross-sectoral representation. In performing this
        task, the Lead Overseer should rely on the information provided by competent
        authorities in the context of designation of the critical ICT third-party
        service providers, including the results of the calculation of all the sub-criteria
        as defined in Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2024/1502 3 and consider
        the criticality of the critical ICT third-party service providers for the
        provisioning of specific financial services both at Member State and Union
        level.

        the amount of the oversight fees to be charged by the Lead Overseer to critical
        ICT third-party service providers and the way in which those fees are to be
        paid, the Lead Overseer should include in such arrangements a section detailing
        the procedure of reimbursement of the direct and indirect costs of all nominating
        authorities involved in the joint examination teams. The arrangements should
        also ensure that the members of the joint examination teams are free from
