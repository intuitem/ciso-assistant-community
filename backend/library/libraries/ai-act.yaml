      description: AI systems  can be easily deployed in a large variety of sectors
        of the economy and many parts of society, including across borders, and can
        easily circulate throughout the Union. Certain Member States have already
        explored the adoption of national rules to ensure that AI is trustworthy and
        safe and is developed and used in accordance with fundamental rights obligations.
        Diverging national rules may lead to the fragmentation of the internal market
        and may decrease legal certainty for operators that develop, import or use
        AI systems. A consistent and high level of protection throughout the Union
        should therefore be ensured in order to achieve trustworthy AI, while divergences
        hampering the free circulation, innovation, deployment and the uptake of AI
        systems and related products and services within the internal market should
        be prevented by laying down uniform obligations for operators and guaranteeing
        the uniform protection of overriding reasons of public interest and of rights
        of persons throughout the internal market on the basis of Article 114 of the
        Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). To the extent that
        this Regulation contains specific rules on the protection of individuals with
        regard to the processing of personal data concerning restrictions of the use
        of AI systems for remote biometric identification for the purpose of law enforcement,
        of the use of AI systems for risk assessments of natural persons for the purpose
        of law enforcement and of the use of AI systems of biometric categorisation
        for the purpose of law enforcement, it is appropriate to base this Regulation,
        in so far as those specific rules are concerned, on Article 16 TFEU. In light
        of those specific rules and the recourse to Article 16 TFEU, it is appropriate
        to consult the European Data Protection Board.

      description: A Union legal framework laying down harmonised rules on AI is therefore
        needed to foster the development, use and uptake of AI in the internal market
        that at the same time meets a high level of protection of public interests,
        such as health and safety and the protection of fundamental rights, including
        democracy, the rule of law and environmental protection as recognised and
        protected by Union law. To achieve that objective, rules regulating the placing
        on the market, the putting into service and the use of certain AI systems
        should be laid down, thus ensuring the smooth functioning of the internal
        market and allowing those systems to benefit from the principle of free movement
        of goods and services. Those rules should be clear and robust in protecting
        fundamental rights, supportive of new innovative solutions, enabling a European
        ecosystem of public and private actors creating AI systems in line with Union
        values and unlocking the potential of the digital transformation across all
        regions of the Union. By laying down those rules as well as measures in support
        of innovation with a particular focus on small and medium enterprises (SMEs),
        including startups, this Regulation supports the objective of promoting the
        European human-centric approach to AI and being a global leader in the development
        of secure, trustworthy and ethical AI  as stated by the European Council,
        and it ensures the protection of ethical principles, as specifically requested
        by the European Parliament.

        \ their capability to infer. This capability to infer refers to the process\
        \ of obtaining the outputs, such as predictions, content, recommendations,\
        \ or decisions, which can influence physical and virtual environments, and\
        \ to a capability of AI systems to derive models or algorithms from inputs\

        and effective set of binding rules, it is important to recall the 2019 Ethics
        guidelines for trustworthy AI developed by the independent AI HLEG appointed
        by the Commission. In those guidelines, the AI HLEG developed seven non-binding
        ethical principles for AI which are intended to help ensure that AI is trustworthy
        and ethically sound. The seven principles include human agency and oversight;
        technical robustness and safety; privacy and data governance; transparency;
        diversity, non-discrimination and fairness; societal and environmental well-being
        and accountability. Without prejudice to the legally binding requirements
        of this Regulation and any other applicable Union law, those guidelines contribute
        to the design of a coherent, trustworthy and human-centric AI, in line with
        the Charter and with the values on which the Union is founded. According to
        the guidelines of the AI HLEG, human agency and oversight means that AI systems
        are developed and used as a tool that serves people, respects human dignity
        and personal autonomy, and that is functioning in a way that can be appropriately
        controlled and overseen by humans. Technical robustness and safety means that
        AI systems are developed and used in a way that allows robustness in the case
        of problems and resilience against attempts to alter the use or performance
        of the AI system so as to allow unlawful use by third parties, and minimise
        unintended harm. Privacy and data governance means that AI systems are developed
        and used in accordance with privacy and data protection rules, while processing
        data that meets high standards in terms of quality and integrity. Transparency
        means that AI systems are developed and used in a way that allows appropriate
        traceability and explainability, while making humans aware that they communicate
        or interact with an AI system, as well as duly informing deployers of the
        capabilities and limitations of that AI system and affected persons about
        their rights. Diversity, non-discrimination and fairness means that AI systems
        are developed and used in a way that includes diverse actors and promotes
        equal access, gender equality and cultural diversity, while avoiding discriminatory
        impacts and unfair biases that are prohibited by Union or national law. Social
        and environmental well-being means that AI systems are developed and used
        in a sustainable and environmentally friendly manner as well as in a way to
        benefit all human beings, while monitoring and assessing the long- term impacts
        on the individual, society and democracy. The application of those principles
        should be translated, when possible, in the design and use of AI models. They
        should in any case serve as a basis for the drafting of codes of conduct under
        this Regulation. All stakeholders, including industry, academia, civil society
        and standardisation organisations, are encouraged to take into account as
        appropriate the ethical principles for the development of voluntary best practices
        and standards.

        \ under those areas because they do not materially influence the decision-making\
        \ or do not harm those interests substantially. For the purposes of this Regulation\

        \ should be understood to be an AI system that does not have an impact on\
        \ the substance, and thereby the outcome, of decision-making, whether human\
        \ or automated. An AI system that does not materially influence the outcome\
        \ of decision- making could include situations in which one or more of the\
        \ following conditions are fulfilled. The first such condition should be that\
        \ the AI system is intended to perform a narrow procedural task, such as an\
        \ AI system that transforms unstructured data into structured data, an AI\
        \ system that classifies incoming documents into categories or an AI system\
        \ that is used to detect duplicates among a large number of applications.\
        \ Those tasks are of such narrow and limited nature that they pose only limited\
        \ risks which are not increased through the use in a context that is listed\
        \ as a high-risk use in an annex to this Regulation. The second condition\
        \ should be that the task performed by the AI system is intended to improve\
        \ the result of a previously completed human activity that may be relevant\
        \ for the purposes of that list. Considering those characteristics, the AI\
        \ system provides only an additional layer to a human activity with consequently\
        \ lowered risk. That condition would, for example, apply to AI systems that\
        \ are intended to improve the language used in previously drafted documents,\
        \ for instance in relation to professional tone, academic style of language\
        \ or by aligning text to a certain brand messaging. \nThe third condition\
        \ should be that the AI system is intended to detect decision-making patterns\
        \ or deviations from prior decision-making patterns. The risk would be lowered\
        \ because the use of the AI system follows a previously completed human assessment\
        \ which it is not meant to replace or influence, without proper human review.\
        \ Such AI systems include for instance those that, given a certain grading\
        \ pattern of a teacher, can be used to check ex post whether the teacher may\
        \ have deviated from the grading pattern so as to flag potential inconsistencies\
        \ or anomalies. The fourth condition should be that the AI system is intended\
        \ to perform a task that is only preparatory to an assessment relevant for\
        \ the purposes of the AI systems listed in an annex to this Regulation, thus\
        \ making the possible impact of the output of the system very low in terms\
        \ of representing a risk for the assessment to follow. That condition covers,\
        \ inter alia, smart solutions for file handling, which include various functions\
        \ from indexing, searching, text and speech processing or linking data to\
        \ other data sources, or AI systems used for translation of initial documents.\
        \ In any case, those high-risk AI systems should be considered to pose significant\
        \ risks of harm to the health, safety or fundamental rights of natural persons\
        \ if the AI system implies profiling within the meaning of Article 4, point\
        \ (4) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 or Article 3, point (4) of Directive (EU)\
        \ 2016/680 or Article 3, point (5) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725. To ensure\
        \ traceability and transparency, a provider who considers that an AI systems\
        \ is not high-risk on the basis of those conditions should draw up documentation\
        \ of the assessment before that system is placed on the market or put into\
        \ service and should provide this documentation to national competent authorities\
        \ upon request. Such a provider should be obliged to register the system in\

        and it does not become a source of discrimination prohibited by Union law.
        High-quality data sets for training, validation and testing require the implementation

        in view of the intended purpose of the system. In order to facilitate compliance
        with Union data protection law, such as Regulation (EU) 2016/679, data governance
        and management practices should include, in the case of personal data, transparency
        about the original purpose of the data collection. The data sets should also

        the systems are implemented in real world settings.

        Results provided by AI systems could be influenced by such inherent biases

      description: 'The notion of general-purpose AI models should be clearly defined
        and set apart from the notion of AI systems to enable legal certainty. The
        definition should be based on the key functional characteristics of a general-purpose
        AI model, in particular the generality and the capability to competently perform
        a wide range of distinct tasks. These models are typically trained on large
        amounts of data, through various methods, such as self- supervised, unsupervised
        or reinforcement learning. General-purpose AI models may be placed on the
        market in various ways, including through libraries, application programming
        interfaces (APIs), as direct download, or as physical copy. These models may
        be further modified or fine-tuned into new models. Although AI models are
        essential components of AI systems, they do not constitute AI systems on their
        own. AI models require the addition of further components, such as for example
        a user interface, to become AI systems. AI models are typically integrated
        into and form part of AI systems. This Regulation provides specific rules
        for general-purpose AI models and for general-purpose AI models that pose
        systemic risks, which should apply also when these models are integrated or
        form part of an AI system. It should be understood that the obligations for
        the providers of general-purpose AI models should apply once the general-purpose
        AI models are placed on the market.

        When the provider of a general-purpose AI model integrates an own model into
        its own AI system that is made available on the market or put into service,
        that model should be considered to be placed on the market and, therefore,
        the obligations in this Regulation for models should continue to apply in
        addition to those for AI systems. The obligations laid down for models should
        in any case not apply when an own model is used for purely internal processes
        that are not essential for providing a product or a service to third parties
        and the rights of natural persons are not affected. Considering their potential
        significantly negative effects, the general-purpose AI models with systemic
        risk should always be subject to the relevant obligations under this Regulation.
        The definition should not cover AI models used before their placing on the
        market for the sole purpose of research, development and prototyping activities.
        This is without prejudice to the obligation to comply with this Regulation
        when, following such activities, a model is placed on the market.'

      description: It is also necessary to clarify a procedure for the classification
        of a general-purpose AI model with systemic risks. A general-purpose AI model
        that meets the applicable threshold for high-impact capabilities should be
        presumed to be a general-purpose AI models with systemic risk. The provider
        should notify the AI Office at the latest two weeks after the requirements
        are met or it becomes known that a general-purpose AI model will meet the
        requirements that lead to the presumption. This is especially relevant in
        relation to the FLOP threshold because training of general-purpose AI models
        takes considerable planning which includes the upfront allocation of compute
        resources and, therefore, providers of general-purpose AI models are able
        to know if their model would meet the threshold before the training is completed.
        In the context of that notification, the provider should be able to demonstrate
        that, because of its specific characteristics, a general-purpose AI model
        exceptionally does not present systemic risks, and that it thus should not
        be classified as a general-purpose AI model with systemic risks. That information
        is valuable for the AI Office to anticipate the placing on the market of general-purpose
        AI models with systemic risks and the providers can start to engage with the
        AI Office early on. That information is especially important with regard to
        general- purpose AI models that are planned to be released as open-source,
        given that, after open-source model release, necessary measures to ensure
        compliance with the obligations under this Regulation may be more difficult
        to implement.

        authorities, agencies or bodies, should register themselves in such database
        and select the system that they envisage to use.

        Other deployers should be entitled to do so voluntarily. This section of the
        database should be publicly accessible, free of charge, the information should
        be easily navigable, understandable and machine-readable. The database should
        also be user-friendly, for example by providing search functionalities, including
        through keywords, allowing the general public to find relevant information
        to be submitted upon the registration of high- risk AI systems and on the
        high-risk AI systems, set out in annexes to this Regulation, to which the
        high-risk AI systems correspond. Any substantial modification of high-risk
        AI systems should also be registered in the EU database. For high-risk AI
        systems in the area of law enforcement, migration, asylum and border control
        management, the registration obligations should be fulfilled in a secure non-public
        section of the database. Access to the secure non-public section should be
        strictly limited to the Commission as well as to market surveillance authorities
        with regard to their national section of that database. High-risk AI systems
        in the area of critical infrastructure should only be registered at national
        level. The Commission should be the controller of the EU database, in accordance
        with Regulation (EU) 2018/1725. In order to ensure the full functionality
        of the database, when deployed, the procedure for setting the database should
        include the elaboration of functional specifications by the Commission and
        an independent audit report. The Commission should take into account cybersecurity
        and hazard-related risks when carrying out its tasks as data controller on
        the EU database. In order to maximise the availability and use of the database
        by the public, the database, including the information made available through
        it, should comply with requirements under the Directive (EU) 2019/882.'

      description: Certain AI systems intended to interact with natural persons or
        to generate content may pose specific risks of impersonation or deception
        irrespective of whether they qualify as high-risk or not. In certain circumstances,
        the use of these systems should therefore be subject to specific transparency
        obligations without prejudice to the requirements and obligations for high-risk
        AI systems and subject to targeted exceptions to take into account the special
        need of law enforcement. In particular, natural persons should be notified

        and circumspect taking into account the circumstances and the context of use.
        When implementing such obligation, the characteristics of individuals belonging

        hair colour, eye colour, tattoos, personal traits, ethnic origin, personal
        preferences and interests. Such information and notifications should be provided

      description: A variety of AI systems can generate large quantities of synthetic
        content that becomes increasingly hard for humans to distinguish from human-generated
        and authentic content. The wide availability and increasing capabilities of
        those systems have a significant impact on the integrity and trust in the
        information ecosystem, raising new risks of misinformation and manipulation
        at scale, fraud, impersonation and consumer deception. In light of those impacts,
        the fast technological pace and the need for new methods and techniques to
        trace origin of information, it is appropriate to require providers of those
        systems to embed technical solutions that enable marking in a machine readable
        format and detection that the output has been generated or manipulated by
        an AI system and not a human. Such techniques and methods should be sufficiently
        reliable, interoperable, effective and robust as far as this is technically
        feasible, taking into account available techniques or a combination of such
        techniques, such as watermarks, metadata identifications, cryptographic methods
        for proving provenance and authenticity of content, logging methods, fingerprints
        or other techniques, as may be appropriate. When implementing this obligation,
        providers should also take into account the specificities and the limitations
        of the different types of content and the relevant technological and market
        developments in the field, as reflected in the generally acknowledged state-of-the-art.
        Such techniques and methods can be implemented at the level of the system
        or at the level of the model, including general- purpose AI models generating
        content, thereby facilitating fulfilment of this obligation by the downstream
        provider of the AI system. To remain proportionate, it is appropriate to envisage
        that this marking obligation should not cover AI systems performing primarily
        an assistive function for standard editing or AI systems not substantially
        altering the input data provided by the deployer or the semantics thereof.

        pose a significant risk of harm to the health, safety or fundamental rights
        of natural persons.

        The Commission shall adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 97 in
        order to delete any of the conditions laid down in the paragraph 3, first

        demand for participation; prospective providers may also submit applications
        in partnerships with users and other relevant third parties;

        (c) the detailed arrangements for and conditions concerning AI regulatory
        sandboxes to the best extent possible support flexibility for national competent
        authorities to establish and operate their AI regulatory sandboxes;

        (d) access to the AI regulatory sandboxes is free of charge for SMEs, including
        start- ups, without prejudice to exceptional costs that national competent
        authorities may recover in a fair and proportionate manner;

        (e) they facilitate prospective providers, by means of the learning outcomes
        of the AI regulatory sandboxes, in complying with conformity assessment obligations
        under this Regulation and the voluntary application of the codes of conduct
        referred to in Article 95;

        (f) AI regulatory sandboxes facilitate the involvement of other relevant actors
        within the AI ecosystem, such as notified bodies and standardisation organisations,
        SMEs, start-ups, enterprises, innovators, testing and experimentation facilities,
        research and experimentation labs and European Digital Innovation Hubs, centres
        of excellence, individual researchers, in order to allow and facilitate cooperation
        with the public and private sectors;'

        4.1. In addition to the application referred to in point 3, an application
        with a notified body of their choice shall be lodged by the provider for the
        assessment of the technical documentation relating to the AI system which
        the provider intends to place on the market or put into service and which
        is covered by the quality management system referred to under point 3.

        4.2. The application shall include:

        (a) the name and address of the provider;

        (b) a written declaration that the same application has not been lodged with
        any other notified body;

        (c) the technical documentation referred to in Annex IV.

        4.3. The technical documentation shall be examined by the notified body. Where
        relevant and limited to what is necessary to fulfil its tasks, the notified
        body shall be granted full access to the training, validation, and testing
        data sets used, including, where appropriate and subject to security safeguards,
        through API or other relevant technical means and tools enabling remote access.

        4.4. In examining the technical documentation, the notified body may require
        that the provider supply further evidence or carry out further tests so as
        to enable a proper assessment of the conformity of the AI system with the
        requirements set out in Chapter III, Section 2. Where the notified body is
        not satisfied with the tests carried out by the provider, the notified body
        shall itself directly carry out adequate tests, as appropriate.

        4.5. Where necessary to assess the conformity of the high-risk AI system with
        the requirements set out in Chapter III, Section 2, after all other reasonable
        means to verify conformity have been exhausted and have proven to be insufficient,
        and upon a reasoned request, the notified body shall also be granted access
        to the training and trained models of the AI system, including its relevant
        parameters. Such access shall be subject to existing Union law on the protection
        of intellectual property and trade secrets.

        4.6. The decision of the notified body shall be notified to the provider or
        its authorised representative. The notification shall contain the conclusions
        of the assessment of the technical documentation and the reasoned assessment
        decision.

        Where the AI system is in conformity with the requirements set out in Chapter
        III, Section 2, the notified body shall issue a Union technical documentation
        assessment certificate. The certificate shall indicate the name and address
        of the provider, the conclusions of the examination, the conditions (if any)
        for its validity and the data necessary for the identification of the AI system.

        The certificate and its annexes shall contain all relevant information to
        allow the conformity of the AI system to be evaluated, and to allow for control
        of the AI system while in use, where applicable.

        Where the AI system is not in conformity with the requirements set out in
        Chapter III, Section 2, the notified body shall refuse to issue an Union technical
        documentation assessment certificate and shall inform the applicant accordingly,
        giving detailed reasons for its refusal.

        Where the AI system does not meet the requirement relating to the data used
        to train it, re- training of the AI system will be needed prior to the application
        for a new conformity assessment. In this case, the reasoned assessment decision
        of the notified body refusing to issue the Union technical documentation assessment
        certificate shall contain specific considerations on the quality data used
        to train the AI system, in particular on the reasons for non-compliance.

        4.7. Any change to the AI system that could affect the compliance of the AI
        system with the requirements or its intended purpose shall be assessed by
        the notified body which issued the Union technical documentation assessment
        certificate. The provider shall inform such notified body of its intention
        to introduce any of the abovementioned changes, or if it otherwise becomes
        aware of the occurrence of such changes. The intended changes shall be assessed
        by the notified body, which shall decide whether those changes require a new
        conformity assessment in accordance with Article 43(4) or whether they could
        be addressed by means of a supplement to the Union technical documentation
        assessment certificate. In the latter case, the notified body shall assess
        the changes, notify the provider of its decision and, where the changes are
        approved, issue to the provider a supplement to the Union technical documentation
        assessment certificate.'
