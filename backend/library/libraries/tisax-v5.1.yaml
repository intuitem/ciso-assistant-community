      description: "Within the context of VDA ISA, the term contractor includes both\
        \ classic suppliers and subcontractors but also classic service providers,\
        \ freelancers or other partner companies. It also includes cooperation partners\
        \ (e.g. academic institutions, institutes).\n\nThe explanations below describe\
        \ a possible procedure for fulfilling the requirements:\n\nIdentification\
        \ of contractors and specification of protection needs and security requirements:\n\
        At first, all contractors must be identified (e.g. via the list of creditors\
        \ of the accountants department) in order to gain an initial overview. \n\
        For all contractors, the respective protection needs should be specified and\
        \ the security requirements derived according to their tasks and the relevance\
        \ to own and customer\u2019s processes. \nGenerally, a large number of contractors\
        \ is found not to require the assignment of relevant protection needs and\
        \ to be therefore not subject to security requirements (e.g. suppliers of\
        \ office stationary). \n\nEnsuring implementation by the contractor:\nIn the\
        \ next step, the applicable requirements must be made known to all security-relevant\
        \ contractors in a suitable manner and (contractually) fixed as being mandatory.\
        \ Finally, a decision should be made as to how the implementation of the security\
        \ requirements can be appropriately verified. For this purpose, adequate verification\
        \ processes and procedures should be defined according to the respective risk\
        \ (and the associated protection needs). Their purpose is to ensure that contractors\
        \ implement the necessary requirements.\n\nEstablishment in standard processes:\n\
        The insights gained should be used to develop a comprehensible procedure and\
        \ to integrate it into the existing processes of the B2B\_/ supplier management.\
        \ This starts with the selection of the contractor, where aspects of information\
        \ security should already be taken into account alongside criteria such as\
        \ quality, adherence to delivery dates, credit rating etc. The procurement\
        \ process should be such that the relevance of information security has already\
        \ been taken into account beforehand (with respect to the procurement decision;\
        \ contract design; inspection requirements).\nFurthermore, it is recommended\
        \ to incorporate information security aspects into existing processes for\
        \ supplier evaluation which have already been established by e.g. an existing\
        \ quality management system.\nContractually specified deliverables (e.g. availability\
        \ requirements) should be verified at regular intervals. This can be done\
        \ by e.g. regular analysis of service reports and SLAs.  "
