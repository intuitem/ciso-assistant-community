      or replay attacks ([Exploitation for Credential Access](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1212)).
      By abusing features of common networking protocols that can determine the flow
      of network traffic (e.g. ARP, DNS, LLMNR, etc.), adversaries may force a device
      to communicate through an adversary controlled system so they can collect information
      or perform additional actions.(Citation: Rapid7 MiTM Basics)


      For example, adversaries may manipulate victim DNS settings to enable other
      malicious activities such as preventing/redirecting users from accessing legitimate
      sites and/or pushing additional malware.(Citation: ttint_rat)(Citation: dns_changer_trojans)(Citation:
      ad_blocker_with_miner) Adversaries may also manipulate DNS and leverage their

      volexity_0day_sophos_FW) [Downgrade Attack](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1562/010)s
      can also be used to establish an AiTM position, such as by negotiating a less

      encryption algorithm.(Citation: mitm_tls_downgrade_att)(Citation: taxonomy_downgrade_att_tls)(Citation:

      Adversaries may also leverage the AiTM position to attempt to monitor and/or
      modify traffic, such as in [Transmitted Data Manipulation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1565/002).
      Adversaries can setup a position similar to AiTM to prevent traffic from flowing
      to the appropriate destination, potentially to [Impair Defenses](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1562)

      The information may be collected in a number of different ways using other Discovery
      techniques, because user and username details are prevalent throughout a system
      and include running process ownership, file/directory ownership, session information,
      and system logs. Adversaries may use the information from [System Owner/User

      the target and/or attempts specific actions.


      Various utilities and commands may acquire this information, including <code>whoami</code>.
      In macOS and Linux, the currently logged in user can be identified with <code>w</code>
      and <code>who</code>. On macOS the <code>dscl . list /Users | grep -v ''_''</code>

      malicious functionality used for persistence or command and control. Traffic
      signaling involves the use of a magic value or sequence that must be sent to
      a system to trigger a special response, such as opening a closed port or executing
      a malicious task. This may take the form of sending a series of packets with
      certain characteristics before a port will be opened that the adversary can
      use for command and control. Usually this series of packets consists of attempted
      connections to a predefined sequence of closed ports (i.e. [Port Knocking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1205/001)),
      but can involve unusual flags, specific strings, or other unique characteristics.
      After the sequence is completed, opening a port may be accomplished by the host-based
      firewall, but could also be implemented by custom software.


      Adversaries may also communicate with an already open port, but the service
      listening on that port will only respond to commands or trigger other malicious
      functionality if passed the appropriate magic value(s).


      The observation of the signal packets to trigger the communication can be conducted
      through different methods. One means, originally implemented by Cd00r (Citation:
      Hartrell cd00r 2002), is to use the libpcap libraries to sniff for the packets
      in question. Another method leverages raw sockets, which enables the malware
      to use ports that are already open for use by other programs.


      On network devices, adversaries may use crafted packets to enable [Network Device
      Authentication](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1556/004) for standard
      services offered by the device such as telnet.  Such signaling may also be used
      to open a closed service port such as telnet, or to trigger module modification
      of malware implants on the device, adding, removing, or changing malicious capabilities.  Adversaries
      may use crafted packets to attempt to connect to one or more (open or closed)
      ports, but may also attempt to connect to a router interface, broadcast, and
      network address IP on the same port in order to achieve their goals and objectives.(Citation:
      Cisco Synful Knock Evolution)(Citation: Mandiant - Synful Knock)(Citation: Cisco

      adversaries must first achieve and leverage [Patch System Image](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1601/001)
      due to the monolithic nature of the architecture.


      Adversaries may also use the Wake-on-LAN feature to turn on powered off systems.
      Wake-on-LAN is a hardware feature that allows a powered down system to be powered

      those restrictions.


      When initially gaining access to a system, an adversary may be operating within
      a lower privileged process which will prevent them from accessing certain resources
      on the system. Vulnerabilities may exist, usually in operating system components
      and software commonly running at higher permissions, that can be exploited to
      gain higher levels of access on the system. This could enable someone to move
      from unprivileged or user level permissions to SYSTEM or root permissions depending
      on the component that is vulnerable. This could also enable an adversary to
      move from a virtualized environment, such as within a virtual machine or container,

      The Server Message Block (SMB) protocol is commonly used in Windows networks
      for authentication and communication between systems for access to resources
      and file sharing. When a Windows system attempts to connect to an SMB resource
      it will automatically attempt to authenticate and send credential information
      for the current user to the remote system. (Citation: Wikipedia Server Message
      Block) This behavior is typical in enterprise environments so that users do
      not need to enter credentials to access network resources.


      Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) is also typically used by
      Windows systems as a backup protocol when SMB is blocked or fails. WebDAV is
      an extension of HTTP and will typically operate over TCP ports 80 and 443. (Citation:
      Didier Stevens WebDAV Traffic) (Citation: Microsoft Managing WebDAV Security)


      Adversaries may take advantage of this behavior to gain access to user account
      hashes through forced SMB/WebDAV authentication. An adversary can send an attachment
      to a user through spearphishing that contains a resource link to an external
      server controlled by the adversary (i.e. [Template Injection](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1221)),
      or place a specially crafted file on navigation path for privileged accounts
      (e.g. .SCF file placed on desktop) or on a publicly accessible share to be accessed
      by victim(s). When the user''s system accesses the untrusted resource it will
      attempt authentication and send information, including the user''s hashed credentials,
      over SMB to the adversary controlled server. (Citation: GitHub Hashjacking)
      With access to the credential hash, an adversary can perform off-line [Brute

      The document can include, for example, a request similar to <code>file[:]//[remote

      Devices such as routers and firewalls can be used to create boundaries between

      on how the adversary can bypass them when compromised.


      When an adversary takes control of such a boundary device, they can bypass its
      policy enforcement to pass normally prohibited traffic across the trust boundary
      between the two separated networks without hinderance.  By achieving sufficient
      rights on the device, an adversary can reconfigure the device to allow the traffic

      include a program being allowed to run because it is signed by a valid code
      signing certificate, a program prompting the user with a warning because it
      has an attribute set from being downloaded from the Internet, or getting an
      indication that you are about to connect to an untrusted site.


      Adversaries may attempt to subvert these trust mechanisms. The method adversaries
      use will depend on the specific mechanism they seek to subvert. Adversaries
      may conduct [File and Directory Permissions Modification](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1222)

    description: 'Adversaries may exploit software vulnerabilities in client applications
      to execute code. Vulnerabilities can exist in software due to unsecure coding
      practices that can lead to unanticipated behavior. Adversaries can take advantage
      of certain vulnerabilities through targeted exploitation for the purpose of
      arbitrary code execution. Oftentimes the most valuable exploits to an offensive
      toolkit are those that can be used to obtain code execution on a remote system
      because they can be used to gain access to that system. Users will expect to
      see files related to the applications they commonly used to do work, so they
      are a useful target for exploit research and development because of their high
      utility.


      Several types exist:


      ### Browser-based Exploitation


      Web browsers are a common target through [Drive-by Compromise](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1189)
      and [Spearphishing Link](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566/002). Endpoint
      systems may be compromised through normal web browsing or from certain users
      being targeted by links in spearphishing emails to adversary controlled sites
      used to exploit the web browser. These often do not require an action by the
      user for the exploit to be executed.


      ### Office Applications


      Common office and productivity applications such as Microsoft Office are also
      targeted through [Phishing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566). Malicious
      files will be transmitted directly as attachments or through links to download
      them. These require the user to open the document or file for the exploit to
      run.


      ### Common Third-party Applications


      Other applications that are commonly seen or are part of the software deployed
      in a target network may also be used for exploitation. Applications such as
      Adobe Reader and Flash, which are common in enterprise environments, have been
      routinely targeted by adversaries attempting to gain access to systems. Depending
      on the software and nature of the vulnerability, some may be exploited in the
      browser or require the user to open a file. For instance, some Flash exploits
      have been delivered as objects within Microsoft Office documents.

    name: Endpoint Denial of Service
    description: 'Adversaries may perform Endpoint Denial of Service (DoS) attacks
      to degrade or block the availability of services to users. Endpoint DoS can
      be performed by exhausting the system resources those services are hosted on
      or exploiting the system to cause a persistent crash condition. Example services
      include websites, email services, DNS, and web-based applications. Adversaries
      have been observed conducting DoS attacks for political purposes(Citation: FireEye
      OpPoisonedHandover February 2016) and to support other malicious activities,
      including distraction(Citation: FSISAC FraudNetDoS September 2012), hacktivism,
      and extortion.(Citation: Symantec DDoS October 2014)


      An Endpoint DoS denies the availability of a service without saturating the
      network used to provide access to the service. Adversaries can target various
      layers of the application stack that is hosted on the system used to provide
      the service. These layers include the Operating Systems (OS), server applications
      such as web servers, DNS servers, databases, and the (typically web-based) applications
      that sit on top of them. Attacking each layer requires different techniques
      that take advantage of bottlenecks that are unique to the respective components.
      A DoS attack may be generated by a single system or multiple systems spread
      across the internet, which is commonly referred to as a distributed DoS (DDoS).


      To perform DoS attacks against endpoint resources, several aspects apply to
      multiple methods, including IP address spoofing and botnets.


      Adversaries may use the original IP address of an attacking system, or spoof
      the source IP address to make the attack traffic more difficult to trace back
      to the attacking system or to enable reflection. This can increase the difficulty
      defenders have in defending against the attack by reducing or eliminating the
      effectiveness of filtering by the source address on network defense devices.


      Botnets are commonly used to conduct DDoS attacks against networks and services.
      Large botnets can generate a significant amount of traffic from systems spread
      across the global internet. Adversaries may have the resources to build out
      and control their own botnet infrastructure or may rent time on an existing
      botnet to conduct an attack. In some of the worst cases for DDoS, so many systems
      are used to generate requests that each one only needs to send out a small amount
      of traffic to produce enough volume to exhaust the target''s resources. In such
      circumstances, distinguishing DDoS traffic from legitimate clients becomes exceedingly
      difficult. Botnets have been used in some of the most high-profile DDoS attacks,
      such as the 2012 series of incidents that targeted major US banks.(Citation:
      USNYAG IranianBotnet March 2016)


      In cases where traffic manipulation is used, there may be points in the global
      network (such as high traffic gateway routers) where packets can be altered
      and cause legitimate clients to execute code that directs network packets toward
      a target in high volume. This type of capability was previously used for the
      purposes of web censorship where client HTTP traffic was modified to include
      a reference to JavaScript that generated the DDoS code to overwhelm target web
      servers.(Citation: ArsTechnica Great Firewall of China)

      A Network DoS will occur when the bandwidth capacity of the network connection
      to a system is exhausted due to the volume of malicious traffic directed at
      the resource or the network connections and network devices the resource relies
      on. For example, an adversary may send 10Gbps of traffic to a server that is
      hosted by a network with a 1Gbps connection to the internet. This traffic can
      be generated by a single system or multiple systems spread across the internet,
      which is commonly referred to as a distributed DoS (DDoS).


      To perform Network DoS attacks several aspects apply to multiple methods, including
      IP address spoofing, and botnets.


      Adversaries may use the original IP address of an attacking system, or spoof
      the source IP address to make the attack traffic more difficult to trace back
      to the attacking system or to enable reflection. This can increase the difficulty
      defenders have in defending against the attack by reducing or eliminating the
      effectiveness of filtering by the source address on network defense devices.

    description: 'Adversaries may modify access tokens to operate under a different

      Windows uses access tokens to determine the ownership of a running process.
      A user can manipulate access tokens to make a running process appear as though
      it is the child of a different process or belongs to someone other than the
      user that started the process. When this occurs, the process also takes on the
      security context associated with the new token.


      An adversary can use built-in Windows API functions to copy access tokens from
      existing processes; this is known as token stealing. These token can then be
      applied to an existing process (i.e. [Token Impersonation/Theft](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1134/001))
      or used to spawn a new process (i.e. [Create Process with Token](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1134/002)).
      An adversary must already be in a privileged user context (i.e. administrator)
      to steal a token. However, adversaries commonly use token stealing to elevate
      their security context from the administrator level to the SYSTEM level. An
      adversary can then use a token to authenticate to a remote system as the account
      for that token if the account has appropriate permissions on the remote system.(Citation:

      Any standard user can use the <code>runas</code> command, and the Windows API
      functions, to create impersonation tokens; it does not require access to an
      administrator account. There are also other mechanisms, such as Active Directory
      fields, that can be used to modify access tokens.

    name: Exploitation for Defense Evasion
    description: "Adversaries may exploit a system or application vulnerability to\
      \ bypass security features. Exploitation of a vulnerability occurs when an adversary\
      \ takes advantage of a programming error in a program, service, or within the\
      \ operating system software or kernel itself to execute adversary-controlled\
      \ code.\_Vulnerabilities may exist in defensive security software that can be\
      \ used to disable or circumvent them.\n\nAdversaries may have prior knowledge\
      \ through reconnaissance that security software exists within an environment\
      \ or they may perform checks during or shortly after the system is compromised\
      \ for [Security Software Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1518/001).\
      \ The security software will likely be targeted directly for exploitation. There\
      \ are examples of antivirus software being targeted by persistent threat groups\
      \ to avoid detection.\n\nThere have also been examples of vulnerabilities in\
      \ public cloud infrastructure of SaaS applications that may bypass defense boundaries\
