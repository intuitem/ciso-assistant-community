        closely monitoring the ever-growing threat posed to information and financial
        systems by nation-states, terrorist organizations and independent criminal
        actors. Recently, cybercriminals have sought to exploit technological vulnerabilities
        to gain access to sensitive electronic data. Cybercriminals can cause significant
        financial losses for DFS regulated entities as well as for New York consumers
        whose private information may be revealed and/or stolen for illicit purposes.
        The financial servicesindustry is a significant target of cybersecurity threats.
        DFS appreciates that many firms have proactively increased their cybersecurity
        programs with great success.
