      name: The app securely stores sensitive data.
      description: Apps handle sensitive data coming from many sources such as the
        user, the backend, system services or other apps on the device and usually
        need to store it locally. The storage locations may be private to the app
        (e.g. its internal storage) or be public and therefore accessible by the user
        or other installed apps (e.g. public folders such as Downloads). This control
        ensures that any sensitive data that is intentionally stored by the app is
        properly protected independently of the target location.

      name: The app prevents leakage of sensitive data.
      description: There are cases when sensitive data is unintentionally stored or
        exposed to publicly accessible locations; typically as a side-effect of using
        certain APIs, system capabilities such as backups or logs. This control covers
        this kind of unintentional leaks where the developer actually has a way to
        prevent it.

        best practices.
      description: Cryptography plays an especially important role in securing the
        user's data - even more so in a mobile environment, where attackers having
        physical access to the user's device is a likely scenario. This control covers
        general cryptography best practices, which are typically defined in external
        standards.

      name: The app uses secure authentication and authorization protocols and follows
        the relevant best practices.
      description: Most apps connecting to a remote endpoint require user authentication
        and also enforce some kind of autho- rization. While the enforcement of these
        mechanisms must be on the remote endpoint, the apps also have to ensure that
        it follows all the relevant best practices to ensure a secure use of the involved
        protocols.

      name: The app performs local authentication securely according to the platform
        best practices.
      description: Many apps allow users to authenticate via biometrics or a local
        PIN code. These authentication mechanisms need to be correctly implemented.
        Additionally, some apps might not have a remote endpoint, and rely fully on
        local app authentication.

      name: The app secures sensitive operations with additional authentication.
      description: Some additional form of authentication is often desirable for sensitive
        actions inside the app. This can be done in different ways (biometric, pin,
        MFA code generator, email, deep links, etc) and they all need to be implemented
        securely.

      name: The app secures all network traffic according to the current best practices.
      description: Ensuring data privacy and integrity of any data in transit is critical
        for any app that communicates over the network. This is typically done by
        encrypting data and authenticating the remote endpoint, as TLS does. However,
        there are many ways for a developer to disable the platform secure defaults,
        or bypass them completely by using low-level APIs or third-party libraries.
        This control ensures that the app is in fact setting up secure connections
        in any situation.

      description: Instead of trusting all the default root CAs of the framework or
        device, this control will make sure that only very specific CAs are trusted.
        This practice is typically called certificate pinning or public key pinning.

      description: Apps typically use platform provided IPC mechanisms to intentionally
        expose data or functionality. Both installed apps and the user are able to
        interact with the app in many different ways. This control ensures that all
        interactions involving IPC mechanisms happen securely.

      description: WebViews are typically used by apps that have a need for increased
        control over the UI. This control ensures that WebViews are configured securely
        to prevent sensitive data leakage as well as sensitive functionality exposure
        (e.g. via JavaScript bridges to native code).

      description: Sensitive data has to be displayed in the UI in many situations
        (e.g. passwords, credit card details, OTP codes in notifications). This control
        ensures that this data doesn't end up being unintentionally leaked due to
        platform mechanisms such as auto-generated screenshots or accidentally disclosed
        via e.g. shoulder surfing or sharing the device with another person.

      description: Every release of the mobile OS includes security patches and new
        security features. By supporting older versions, apps stay vulnerable to well-known
        threats. This control ensures that the app is running on an up-to-date platform
        version so that users have the latest security protections.

      name: The app only uses software components without known vulnerabilities.
      description: To be truly secure, a full whitebox assessment should have been
        performed on all app components. However, as it usually happens with e.g.
        for third-party components this is not always feasible and not typically part
        of a penetration test. This control covers "low-hanging fruit" cases, such
        as those that can be detected just by scanning libraries for known vulnerabilities.

      name: The app validates and sanitizes all untrusted inputs.
      description: Apps have many data entry points including the UI, IPC, the network,
        the file system, etc. This incoming data might have been inadvertently modified
        by untrusted actors and may lead to bypass of critical security checks as
        well as classical injection attacks such as SQL injection, XSS or insecure
        deserialization. This control ensures that this data is treated as untrusted
        input and is properly verified and sanitized before it's used.

      description: Running on a platform that has been tampered with can be very dangerous
        for apps, as this may disable certain security features, putting the data
        of the app at risk. Trusting the platform is essential for many of the MASVS
        controls relying on the platform being secure (e.g. secure storage, biometrics,
        sandboxing, etc.). This control tries to validate that the OS has not been
        compromised and its security features can thus be trusted.

      description: Apps run on a user-controlled device, and without proper protections
        it's relatively easy to run a modified version locally (e.g. to cheat in a
        game, or enable premium features without paying), or upload a back- doored
        version of it to third-party app stores. This control tries to ensure the
        integrity of the app's intended functionality by preventing modifications
        to the original code and resources.

      description: Sometimes pure static analysis is very difficult and time consuming
        so it typically goes hand in hand with dynamic analysis. Observing and manipulating
        an app during runtime makes it much easier to decipher its behavior. This
        control aims to make it as difficult as possible to perform dynamic analysis,
        as well as prevent dynamic instrumentation which could allow an attacker to
        modify the code at runtime.

      description: 'Apps should only request access to the data they absolutely need
        for their functionality and always with informed consent from the user. This
        control ensures that apps practice data minimization and restricts access
        control, reducing the potential impact of data breaches or leaks.

        Furthermore, apps should share data with third parties only when necessary,
        and this should include enforc- ing that third-party SDKs operate based on
        user consent, not by default or without it. Apps should prevent third-party
        SDKs from ignoring consent signals or from collecting data before consent
        is confirmed.

        Additionally, apps should be aware of the ''supply chain'' of SDKs they incorporate,
        ensuring that no data is unnecessarily passed down their chain of dependencies.
        This end-to-end responsibility for data aligns with recent SBOM regulatory
        requirements, making apps more accountable for their data practices.'

        to prevent user identification and tracking.

        Another key aspect addressed by this control is to establish technical barriers
        when employing complex ''fingerprint-like'' signals (e.g. device IDs, IP addresses,
        behavioral patterns) for specific purposes. For in- stance, a fingerprint
        used for fraud detection should be isolated and not repurposed for audience
        measure- ment in an analytics SDK. This ensures that each data stream serves
        its intended function without risking user privacy.'
