      description: In the digital age, information and communication technology (ICT)
        supports complex systems used for everyday activities. It keeps our economies
        running in key sectors, including the financial sector, and enhances the functioning
        of the internal market. Increased digitalisation and interconnectedness also
        amplify ICT risk, making society as a whole, and the financial system in particular,
        more vulnerable to cyber threats or ICT disruptions. While the ubiquitous
        use of ICT systems and high digitalisation and connectivity are today core
        features of the activities of Union financial entities, their digital resilience
        has yet to be better addressed and integrated into their broader operational
        frameworks.

      description: The use of ICT has in the past decades gained a pivotal role in
        the provision of financial services, to the point where it has now acquired
        a critical importance in the operation of typical daily functions of all financial
        entities. Digitalisation now covers, for instance, payments, which have increasingly
        moved from cash and paper-based methods to the use of digital solutions, as
        well as securities clearing and settlement, electronic and algorithmic trading,
        lending and funding operations, peer-to-peer finance, credit rating, claim
        management and back-office operations. The insurance sector has also been
        transformed by the use of ICT, from the emergence of insurance intermediaries
        offering their services online operating with InsurTech, to digital insurance
        underwriting. Finance has not only become largely digital throughout the whole
        sector, but digitalisation has also deepened interconnections and dependencies
        within the financial sector and with third-party infrastructure and service
        providers.

        \ across financial entities, financial markets and financial market infrastructures,\
        \ and particularly the interdependencies of their ICT systems, could constitute\

      description: In recent years, ICT risk has attracted the attention of international,
        Union and national policy makers, regulators and standard-setting bodies in
        an attempt to enhance digital resilience, set standards and coordinate regulatory
        or supervisory work. At international level, the Basel Committee on Banking
        Supervision, the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures, the Financial
        Stability Board, the Financial Stability Institute, as well as the G7 and
        G20 aim to provide competent authorities and market operators across various
        jurisdictions with tools to bolster the resilience of their financial systems.
        That work has also been driven by the need to duly consider ICT risk in the
        context of a highly interconnected global financial system and to seek more
        consistency of relevant best practices.

      description: The Union financial sector is regulated by a Single Rulebook and
        governed by a European system of financial supervision. Nonetheless, provisions
        tackling digital operational resilience and ICT security are not yet fully
        or consistently harmonised, despite digital operational resilience being vital
        for ensuring financial stability and market integrity in the digital age,
        and no less important than, for example, common prudential or market conduct
        standards. The Single Rulebook and system of supervision should therefore
        be developed to also cover digital operational resilience, by strengthening
        the mandates of competent authorities to enable them to supervise the management
        of ICT risk in the financial sector in order to protect the integrity and
        efficiency of the internal market, and to facilitate its orderly functioning.

      description: Legislative disparities and uneven national regulatory or supervisory
        approaches with regard to ICT risk trigger obstacles to the functioning of
        the internal market in financial services, impeding the smooth exercise of
        the freedom of establishment and the provision of services for financial entities
        operating on a cross-border basis. Competition between the same type of financial
        entities operating in different Member States could also be distorted. This
        is the case, in particular, for areas where Union harmonisation has been very
        limited, such as digital operational resilience testing, or absent, such as
        the monitoring of ICT third-party risk. Disparities stemming from developments
        envisaged at national level could generate further obstacles to the functioning
        of the internal market to the detriment of market participants and financial
        stability.

      description: To date, due to the ICT risk related provisions being only partially
        addressed at Union level, there are gaps or overlaps in important areas, such
        as ICT-related incident reporting and digital operational resilience testing,
        and inconsistencies as a result of emerging divergent national rules or cost-ineffective
        application of overlapping rules. This is particularly detrimental for an
        ICT-intensive user such as the financial sector since technology risks have
        no borders and the financial sector deploys its services on a wide cross-border
        basis within and outside the Union. Individual financial entities operating
        on a cross-border basis or holding several authorisations (e.g. one financial
        entity can have a banking, an investment firm, and a payment institution licence,
        each issued by a different competent authority in one or several Member States)
        face operational challenges in addressing ICT risk and mitigating adverse
        impacts of ICT incidents on their own and in a coherent cost-effective way.

      description: As the Single Rulebook has not been accompanied by a comprehensive
        ICT or operational risk framework, further harmonisation of key digital operational
        resilience requirements for all financial entities is required. The development
        of ICT capabilities and overall resilience by financial entities, based on
        those key requirements, with a view to withstanding operational outages, would
        help preserve the stability and integrity of the Union financial markets and
        thus contribute to ensuring a high level of protection of investors and consumers
        in the Union. Since this Regulation aims to contribute to the smooth functioning
        of the internal market, it should be based on the provisions of Article 114
        of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) as interpreted
        in accordance with the consistent case law of the Court of Justice of the
        European Union (Court of Justice).

      description: This Regulation aims to consolidate and upgrade ICT risk requirements
        as part of the operational risk requirements that have, up to this point,
        been addressed separately in various Union legal acts. While those acts covered
        the main categories of financial risk (e.g. credit risk, market risk, counterparty
        credit risk and liquidity risk, market conduct risk), they did not comprehensively
        tackle, at the time of their adoption, all components of operational resilience.
        The operational risk rules, when further developed in those Union legal acts,
        often favoured a traditional quantitative approach to addressing risk (namely
        setting a capital requirement to cover ICT risk) rather than targeted qualitative
        rules for the protection, detection, containment, recovery and repair capabilities
        against ICT-related incidents, or for reporting and digital testing capabilities.
        Those acts were primarily meant to cover and update essential rules on prudential
        supervision, market integrity or conduct. By consolidating and upgrading the
        different rules on ICT risk, all provisions addressing digital risk in the
        financial sector should for the first time be brought together in a consistent
        manner in one single legislative act. Therefore, this Regulation fills in
        the gaps or remedies inconsistencies in some of the prior legal acts, including
        in relation to the terminology used therein, and explicitly refers to ICT
        risk via targeted rules on ICT risk-management capabilities, incident reporting,
        operational resilience testing and ICT third-party risk monitoring. This Regulation
        should thus also raise awareness of ICT risk and acknowledge that ICT incidents
        and a lack of operational resilience have the possibility to jeopardise the
        soundness of financial entities.

        activities and operations. Consistency contributes to enhancing confidence
        in the financial system and preserving its stability especially in times of
        high reliance on ICT systems, platforms and infrastructures, which entails
        increased digital risk. Observing basic cyber hygiene should also avoid imposing
        heavy costs on the economy by minimising the impact and costs of ICT disruptions.

        and coherent application of all components of ICT risk management by the Union
        financial sector.

        level, applying also to three types of financial entities, namely credit institutions,
        trading venues and central counterparties. However, since Directive (EU) 2016/1148
        set out a mechanism of identification at national level of operators of essential
        services, only certain credit institutions, trading venues and central counterparties
        that were identified by the Member States, have been brought into its scope
        in practice, and hence required to comply with the ICT security and incident
        notification requirements laid down in it. Directive (EU) 2022/2555 of the
        European Parliament and of the Council (8) sets a uniform criterion to determine
        the entities falling within its scope of application (size-cap rule) while
        also keeping the three types of financial entities in its scope.

        of the various digital resilience components, by introducing requirements
        on ICT risk management and ICT-related incident reporting that are more stringent
        in comparison to those laid down in the current Union financial services law,
        this higher level constitutes an increased harmonisation also in comparison
        with the requirements laid down in Directive (EU) 2022/2555. Consequently,
        this Regulation constitutes lex specialis with regard to Directive (EU) 2022/2555.
        At the same time, it is crucial to maintain a strong relationship between
        the financial sector and the Union horizontal cybersecurity framework as currently

        by Regulation (EU) 2019/881 of the European Parliament and of the Council
        (11) and the Cooperation Group under Directive (EU) 2022/2555, divergent approaches
        on setting the thresholds and use of taxonomies still exist, or can emerge,
        for the remainder of financial entities. Due to those divergences, there are
        multiple requirements that financial entities must comply with, especially
        when operating across several Member States and when part of a financial group.
        Moreover, such divergences have the potential to hinder the creation of further
        uniform or centralised Union mechanisms that speed up the reporting process
        and support a quick and smooth exchange of information between competent authorities,
        which is crucial for addressing ICT risk in the event of large-scale attacks
        with potentially systemic consequences.

      description: The digital transformation experienced in financial services has
        brought about an unprecedented level of use of, and reliance upon, ICT services.
        Since it has become inconceivable to provide financial services without the
        use of cloud computing services, software solutions and data-related services,
        the Union financial ecosystem has become intrinsically co-dependent on certain
        ICT services provided by ICT service suppliers. Some of those suppliers, innovators
        in developing and applying ICT-based technologies, play a significant role
        in the delivery of financial services, or have become integrated into the
        financial services value chain. They have thus become critical to the stability
        and integrity of the Union financial system. This widespread reliance on services
        supplied by critical ICT third-party service providers, combined with the
        interdependence of the information systems of various market operators, create
        a direct, and potentially severe, risk to the Union financial services system
        and to the continuity of delivery of financial services if critical ICT third-party
        service providers were to be affected by operational disruptions or major
        cyber incidents. Cyber incidents have a distinctive ability to multiply and
        propagate throughout the financial system at a considerably faster pace than
        other types of risk monitored in the financial sector and can extend across
        sectors and beyond geographical borders. They have the potential to evolve
        into a systemic crisis, where trust in the financial system has been eroded
        due to the disruption of functions supporting the real economy, or to substantial
        financial losses, reaching a level which the financial system is unable to
        withstand, or which requires the deployment of heavy shock absorption measures.
        To prevent these scenarios from taking place and thereby endangering the financial
        stability and integrity of the Union, it is essential to provide the convergence
        of supervisory practices relating to ICT third-party risk in finance, in particular
        through new rules enabling the Union oversight of critical ICT third-party
        service providers.

        of the payment services chain and showing strong interconnections with the
        overall financial system, payment systems and payment processing activities
        acquired a critical significance for the functioning of the Union financial
        markets. Cyber-attacks on such systems can cause severe operational business
        disruptions with direct repercussions on key economic functions, such as the
        facilitation of payments, and indirect effects on related economic processes.

        and processing entities are put in place at Union level, Member States may,
