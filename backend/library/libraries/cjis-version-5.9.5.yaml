        Services (CJIS) Division systems and information and to protect and safeguard
        Criminal Justice Information (CJI). This minimum standard of security requirements
        ensures continuity of information protection. The essential premise of the
        CJIS Security Policy is to provide the appropriate controls to protect CJI,
        from creation through dissemination; whether at rest or in transit.

        the controls in the AT family that are implemented within systems and organizations.
        The risk management strategy is an important factor in establishing such policies
        and procedures. Policies and procedures contribute to security and privacy
        assurance. Therefore, it is important that security and privacy programs collaborate
        on the development of awareness and training policy and procedures. Security
        and privacy program policies and procedures at the organization level are
        preferable, in general, and may obviate the need for mission- or system-specific
        policies and procedures. The policy can be included as part of the general
        security and privacy policy or be represented by multiple policies that reflect
        the complex nature of organizations. Procedures can be established for security
        and privacy programs, for mission or business processes, and for systems,
        if needed. Procedures describe how the policies or controls are implemented
        and can be directed at the individual or role that is the object of the procedure.
        Procedures can be documented in system security and privacy plans or in one
        or more separate documents. Events that may precipitate an update to awareness
        and training policy and procedures include assessment or audit findings, security
        incidents or breaches, or changes in applicable laws, executive orders, directives,
        regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines. Simply restating controls
        does not constitute an organizational policy or procedure.

        The content includes an understanding of the need for security and privacy
        as well as actions by users to maintain security and personal privacy and
        to respond to suspected incidents. The content addresses the need for operations
        security and the handling of personally identifiable information. Awareness
        techniques include displaying posters, offering supplies inscribed with security
        and privacy reminders, displaying logon screen messages, generating email
        advisories or notices from organizational officials, and conducting awareness
        events. Literacy training after the initial training described in AT-2a.1
        is conducted at a minimum frequency consistent with applicable laws, directives,

        security and privacy expectations, or a subset of topics from the initial

        assurance. Therefore, it is important that security and privacy programs collaborate
        on the development of incident response policy and procedures. Security and
        privacy program policies and procedures at the organization level are preferable,
        in general, and may obviate the need for mission- or system-specific policies
        and procedures. The policy can be included as part of the general security
        and privacy policy or be represented by multiple policies that reflect the
        complex nature of organizations. Procedures can be established for security
        and privacy programs, for mission or business processes, and for systems,
        if needed. Procedures describe how the policies or controls are implemented
        and can be directed at the individual or role that is the object of the procedure.
        Procedures can be documented in system security and privacy plans or in one
        or more separate documents. Events that may precipitate an update to incident
        response policy and procedures include assessment or audit findings, security
        incidents or breaches, or changes in laws, executive orders, directives, regulations,

        are dependent on the capabilities of organizational systems and the mission
        and business processes being supported by those systems. Organizations consider
        incident response as part of the definition, design, and development of mission
        and business processes and systems. Incident-related information can be obtained

        and network monitoring; user or administrator reports; and reported supply
        chain events. An effective incident handling capability includes coordination

        owners, authorizing officials, human resources offices, physical security
        offices, personnel security offices, legal departments, risk executive [function],
        operations personnel, procurement offices). Suspected security incidents include
        the receipt of suspicious email communications that can contain malicious
        code. Suspected supply chain incidents include the insertion of counterfeit
        hardware or malicious code into organizational systems or system components.
        For federal agencies, an incident that involves personally identifiable information
        is considered a breach. A breach results in unauthorized disclosure, the loss
        of control, unauthorized acquisition, compromise, or a similar occurrence
        where a person other than an authorized user accesses or potentially accesses
        personally identifiable information or an authorized user accesses or potentially

        assurance. Therefore, it is important that security and privacy programs collaborate
        on the development of audit and accountability policy and procedures. Security
        and privacy program policies and procedures at the organization level are
        preferable, in general, and may obviate the need for mission- or system-specific
        policies and procedures. The policy can be included as part of the general
        security and privacy policy or be represented by multiple policies that reflect
        the complex nature of organizations. Procedures can be established for security
        and privacy programs, for mission or business processes, and for systems,
        if needed. Procedures describe how the policies or controls are implemented
        and can be directed at the individual or role that is the object of the procedure.
        Procedures can be documented in system security and privacy plans or in one
        or more separate documents. Events that may precipitate an update to audit
        and accountability policy and procedures include assessment or audit findings,
        security incidents or breaches, or changes in applicable laws, executive orders,

        and procedures. The policy can be included as part of the general security
        and privacy policy or be represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex
        nature of organizations. Procedures can be established for security and privacy
        programs, for mission or business processes, and for systems, if needed. Procedures
        describe how the policies or controls are implemented and can be directed
        at the individual or role that is the object of the procedure. Procedures
        can be documented in system security and privacy plans or in one or more separate
        documents. Events that may precipitate an update to access control policy
        and procedures include assessment or audit findings, security incidents or
        breaches, or changes in laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies,
        standards, and guidelines. Simply restating controls does not constitute an
        organizational policy or procedure.

        plan. Users requiring administrative privileges on system accounts receive
        additional scrutiny by organizational personnel responsible for approving
        such accounts and privileged access, including system owner, mission or business
        owner, senior agency information security officer, or senior agency official
        for privacy. Types of accounts that organizations may wish to prohibit due
        to increased risk include shared, group, emergency, anonymous, temporary,
        and guest accounts. Where access involves personally identifiable information,
        security programs collaborate with the senior agency official for privacy
        to establish the specific conditions for group and role membership; specify
        authorized users, group and role membership, and access authorizations for
        each account; and create, adjust, or remove system accounts in accordance
        with organizational policies. Policies can include such information as account
        expiration dates or other factors that trigger the disabling of accounts.
        Organizations may choose to define access privileges or other attributes by
        account, type of account, or a combination of the two. Examples of other attributes
        required for authorizing access include restrictions on time of day, day of
        week, and point of origin. In defining other system account attributes, organizations
        consider system related requirements and mission/business requirements. Failure

      description: 'Temporary and emergency accounts are intended for short-term use.
        Organizations establish temporary accounts as part of normal account activation
        procedures when there is a need for short- term accounts without the demand
        for immediacy in account activation. Organizations establish emergency accounts
        in response to crisis situations and with the need for rapid account activation.
        Therefore, emergency account activation may bypass normal account authorization
        processes. Emergency and temporary accounts are not to be confused with infrequently
        used accounts, including local logon accounts used for special tasks or when
        network resources are unavailable (may also be known as accounts of last resort).
        Such accounts remain available and are not subject to automatic disabling
        or removal dates. Conditions for disabling or deactivating accounts include
        when shared/group, emergency, or temporary accounts are no longer required
        and when individuals are transferred or terminated. Changing shared/group
        authenticators when members leave the group is intended to ensure that former
        group members do not retain access to the shared or group account. Some types
        of system accounts may require specialized training.

        can travel within a system and between systems (in contrast to who is allowed

        claims to be from within the organization, keeping export-controlled information
        from being transmitted in the clear to the Internet, restricting web requests
        that are not from the internal web proxy server, and limiting information
        transfers between organizations based on data structures and content. Transferring
        information between organizations may require an agreement specifying how
        the information flow is enforced (see CA-3). Transferring information between
        systems in different security or privacy domains with different security or
        privacy policies introduces the risk that such transfers violate one or more
        domain security or privacy policies. In such situations, information owners/stewards
        provide guidance at designated policy enforcement points between connected
        systems. Organizations consider mandating specific architectural solutions
        to enforce specific security and privacy policies. Enforcement includes prohibiting
        information transfers between connected systems (i.e., allowing access only),
        verifying write permissions before accepting information from another security
        or privacy domain or connected system, employing hardware mechanisms to enforce
        one-way information flows, and implementing trustworthy regrading mechanisms
        to reassign security or privacy attributes and labels.Organizations commonly
        employ information flow control policies and enforcement mechanisms to control
        the flow of information between designated sources and destinations within
        systems and between connected systems. Flow control is based on the characteristics
        of the information and/or the information path. Enforcement occurs, for example,
        in boundary protection devices that employ rule sets or establish configuration
        settings that restrict system services, provide a packet-filtering capability
        based on header information, or provide a message-filtering capability based
        on message content. Organizations also consider the trustworthiness of filtering
        and/or inspection mechanisms (i.e., hardware, firmware, and software components)
        that are critical to information flow enforcement. Control enhancements 3
        through 32 primarily address cross- domain solution needs that focus on more
        advanced filtering techniques, in-depth analysis, and stronger flow enforcement
        mechanisms implemented in cross-domain products, such as high- assurance guards.
        Such capabilities are generally not available in commercial off-the-shelf
        products. - Information flow enforcement also applies to control plane traffic
        (e.g., routing and DNS).

      description: 'Discussion: The need to limit unsuccessful logon attempts and
        take subsequent action when the maximum number of attempts is exceeded applies
        regardless of whether the logon occurs via a local or network connection.
        Due to the potential for denial of service, automatic lockouts initiated by
        systems are usually temporary and automatically release after a predetermined,
        organization- defined time period. If a delay algorithm is selected, organizations
        may employ different algorithms for different components of the system based
        on the capabilities of those components.

        Responses to unsuccessful logon attempts may be implemented at the operating
        system and the application levels. Organization-defined actions that may be
        taken when the number of allowed consecutive invalid logon attempts is exceeded
        include prompting the user to answer a secret question in addition to the
        username and password, invoking a lockdown mode with limited user capabilities
        (instead of full lockout), allowing users to only logon from specified Internet
        Protocol (IP) addresses, requiring a CAPTCHA to prevent automated attacks,
        or applying user profiles such as location, time of day, IP address, device,
        or Media Access Control (MAC) address. If automatic system lockout or execution
        of a delay algorithm is not implemented in support of the availability objective,
        organizations consider a combination of other actions to help prevent brute
        force attacks.

        In addition to the above, organizations can prompt users to respond to a secret
        question before the number of allowed unsuccessful logon attempts is exceeded.
        Automatically unlocking an account after a specified period of time is generally
        not permitted. However, exceptions may be required based on operational mission
        or need.

      description: 'Discussion: Remote access is access to organizational systems
        (or processes acting on behalf of users) that communicate through external
        networks such as the Internet. Types of remote access include dial-up, broadband,
        and wireless. Organizations use encrypted virtual private networks (VPNs)
        to enhance confidentiality and integrity for remote connections. The use of
        encrypted VPNs provides sufficient assurance to the organization that it can
        effectively treat such connections as internal networks if the cryptographic
        mechanisms used are implemented in accordance with applicable laws, executive
        orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines. Still,
        VPN connections traverse external networks, and the encrypted VPN does not
        enhance the availability of remote connections. VPNs with encrypted tunnels
        can also affect the ability to adequately monitor network communications traffic
        for malicious code. Remote access controls apply to systems other than public
        web servers or systems designed for public access. Authorization of each remote
        access type addresses authorization prior to allowing remote access without
        specifying the specific formats for such authorization. While organizations
        may use information exchange and system connection security agreements to
        manage remote access connections to other systems, such agreements are addressed

        designed to operate without a physical connection; possesses local, non-removable
        or removable data storage; and includes a self contained power source. Mobile
        device functionality may also include voice communication capabilities, on
        board sensors that allow the device to capture information, and/or built-in
        features for synchronizing local data with remote locations. Examples include
        smart phones and tablets. Mobile devices are typically associated with a single
        individual. The processing, storage, and transmission capability of the mobile
        device may be comparable to or merely a subset of notebook/desktop systems,
        depending on the nature and intendedpurpose of the device. Protection and
        control of mobile devices is behavior or policy-based and requires users to
        take physical action to protect and control such devices when outside of controlled
        areas. Controlled areas are spaces for which organizations provide physical
        or procedural controls to meet the requirements established for protecting
        information and systems. Due to the large variety of mobile devices with different
        characteristics and capabilities, organizational restrictions may vary for
        the different classes or types of such devices. Usage restrictions and specific
        implementation guidance for mobile devices include configuration management,
        device identification and authentication, implementation of mandatory protective
        software, scanning devices for malicious code, updating virus protection software,
        scanning for critical software updates and patches, conducting primary operating
        system (and possibly other resident software) integrity checks, and disabling
        unnecessary hardware. Usage restrictions and authorization to connect may
        vary among organizational systems. For example, the organization may authorize
        the connection of mobile devices to its network and impose a set of usage
        restrictions, while a system owner may withhold authorization for mobile device
        connection to specific applications or impose additional usage restrictions
        before allowing mobile device connections to a system. Adequate security for
        mobile devices goes beyond the requirements specified in AC-19. Many safeguards

        types of external systems, (e.g., prohibit the use of any external system
        that is not organizationally owned or prohibit the use of personally-owned
        systems).

        For some external systems (i.e., systems operated by other organizations),
        the trust relationships that have been established between those organizations
        and the originating organization may be such that no explicit terms and conditions
        are required. Systems within these organizations may not be considered external.
        These situations occur when, for example, there are pre existing information
        exchange agreements (either implicit or explicit) established between organizations
        or components or when such agreements are specified by applicable laws, executive
        orders,directives, regulations, policies, or standards. Authorized individuals
        include organizational personnel, contractors, or other individuals with authorized
        access to organizational systems and over which organizations have the authority
        to impose specific rules of behavior regarding system access. Restrictions
        that organizations impose on authorized individuals need not be uniform, as
        the restrictions may vary depending on trust relationships between organizations.

        Therefore, organizations may choose to impose different security restrictions
        on contractors than on state, local, or tribal governments.

        External systems used to access public interfaces to organizational systems
        are outside the scope of AC-20. Organizations establish specific terms and
        conditions for the use of external systems in accordance with organizational
        security policies and procedures. At a minimum, terms and conditions address
        the specific types of applications that can be accessed on organizational
        systems from external systems and the highest security category of information
        that can be processed, stored, or transmitted on external systems. If the
        terms and conditions with the owners of the external systems cannot be established,
        organizations may impose restrictions on organizational personnel using those
        external systems.

        address the controls in the IA family that are implemented within systems
        and organizations. The risk management strategy is an important factor in

        to security and privacy assurance. Therefore, it is important that security
        and privacy programs collaborate on the development of identification and
        authentication policy and procedures. Security and privacy program policies
        and procedures at the organization level are preferable, in general, and may
        obviate the need for mission- or system-specific policies and procedures.
        The policy can be included as part of the general security and privacy policy
        or be represented by multiple policies that reflect the complex nature of
        organizations. Procedures can be established for security and privacy programs,
        for mission or business processes, and for systems, if needed. Procedures
        describe how the policies or controls are implemented and can be directed
        at the individual or role that is the object of the procedure. Procedures
        can be documented in system security and privacy plans or in one or more separate

      description: 'DISCUSSION: Organizations can satisfy the identification and authentication
        requirements by complying with the requirements in [HSPD 12]. Organizational
        users include employees or individuals who organizations consider to have
        an equivalent status to employees (e.g., contractors and guest researchers).
        Unique identification and authentication of users applies to all accesses
        other than those that are explicitly identified in AC-14 and that occur through
        the authorized use of group authenticators without individual authentication.
        Since processes execute on behalf of groups and roles, organizations may require
        unique identification of individuals in group accounts or for detailed accountability
        of individual activity.

        Organizations employ passwords, physical authenticators, or biometrics to
        authenticate user identities or, in the case of multi-factor authentication,
        some combination thereof. Access to organizational systems is defined as either
        local access or network access. Local access is any access to organizational
        systems by users or processes acting on behalf of users, where access is obtained
        through direct connections without the use of networks. Network access is
        access to organizational systems by users (or processes acting on behalf of
        users) where access is obtainedthrough network connections (i.e., nonlocal
        accesses). Remote access is a type of network access that involves communication
        through external networks. Internal networks include local area networks and
        wide area networks.

        The use of encrypted virtual private networks for network connections between
        organizationcontrolled endpoints and non-organization-controlled endpoints
        may be treated as internal networks with respect to protecting the confidentiality
        and integrity of information traversing the network. Identification and authentication
        requirements for non-organizational users are described in IA-8.

        authenticators include certificates and passwords. Initial authenticator content
        is the actual content of the authenticator (e.g., the initial password). In
        contrast, the requirements for authenticator content contain specific criteria
        or characteristics (e.g., minimum password length). Developers may deliver
        system components with factory default authentication credentials (i.e., passwords)
        to allow for initial installation and configuration. Default authentication
        credentials are often well known, easily discoverable, and present a significant
        risk. The requirement to protect individual authenticators may be implemented
        via control PL-4 or PS-6 for authenticators in the possession of individuals
        and by controls AC-3, AC-6, and SC-28 for authenticators stored in organizational
        systems, including passwords stored in hashed or encrypted formats or files
        containing encrypted or hashed passwords accessible with administrator privileges.

        Systems support authenticator management by organization-defined settings
        and restrictions for various authenticator characteristics (e.g., minimum
        password length, validation time window for time synchronous one-time tokens,
        and number of allowed rejections during the verification stage of biometric
        authentication). Actions can be taken to safeguard individual authenticators,
        including maintaining possession of authenticators, not sharing authenticators
        with others, and immediately reporting lost, stolen, or compromised authenticators.
        Authenticator management includes issuing and revoking authenticators for
        temporary access when no longer needed.

        Information technology products for which configuration settings can be defined
        include mainframe computers, servers, workstations, operating systems, mobile
        devices, input/output devices, protocols, and applications. Parameters that
        impact the security posture of systems include registry settings; account,
        file, or directory permission settings; and settings for functions, protocols,
        ports, services, and remote connections. Privacy parameters are parameters

        to satisfy other privacy controls. Privacy parameters include settings for
        access controls, data processing preferences, and processing and retention
        permissions. Organizations establish organization-wide configuration settings
        and subsequently derive specific configuration settings for systems. The established
        settings become part of the configuration baseline for the system.

        Common secure configurations (also known as security configuration checklists,

        Common secure configurations can be developed by a variety of organizations,
        including information technology product developers, manufacturers, vendors,
        federal agencies, consortia, academia, industry, and other organizations in
        the public and private sectors. Implementation of a common secure configuration
        may be mandated at the organization level, mission and business process level,
        system level, or at a higher level, including by a regulatory agency. Common
        secure configurations include the United States Government Configuration Baseline
        [USGCB] and security technical implementation guides (STIGs), which affect
        the implementation of CM-6 and other controls such as AC-19 and CM-7. The

        technology assets that include hardware, software, and firmware. Organizations
        may choose to implement centralized system component inventories that include
        components from all organizational systems. In such situations, organizations
        ensure that the inventories include system-specific information required for
        component accountability. The information necessary for effective accountability
        of system components includes the system name, software owners, software version
        numbers, hardware inventory specifications, software license information,
        and for

        networked components, the machine names and network addresses across all implemented
        protocols (e.g., IPv4, IPv6). Inventory specifications include date of receipt,
        cost, model, serial number, manufacturer, supplier information, component
        type, and physical location.

        Preventing duplicate accounting of system components addresses the lack of
        accountability that occurs when component ownership and system association
        is not known, especially in large or complex connected systems. Effective
        prevention of duplicate accounting of system components necessitates use of
        a unique identifier for each component. For software inventory, centrally
        managed software that is accessed via other systems is addressed as a component
        of the system on which it is installed and managed. Software installed on
        multiple organizational systems and managed at the system level is addressed
        for each individual system and may appear more than once in a centralized
        component inventory, necessitating a system association for each software
        instance in the centralized inventory to avoid duplicate accounting of components.
        Scanning systems implementing multiple network protocols (e.g., IPv4 and IPv6)
        can result in duplicate components being identified in different address spaces.

        can represent a configuration management plan for the organization with subsets
        of the plan implemented on a system by system basis. Configuration management

        changes to the systems. Configuration items are the system components, such

        The risk management strategy is an important factor in establishing such policies
        and procedures. Policies and procedures contribute to security and privacy
        assurance. Therefore, it is important that security and privacy programs collaborate
        on the development of media protection policy and procedures. Security and
        privacy program policies and procedures at the agency level are preferable,
        in general, and may obviate the need for mission- or system-specific policies
        and procedures. The policy can be included as part of the general security
        and privacy policy or be represented by multiple policies that reflect the
        complex nature of agencies. Procedures can be established for security and
        privacy programs, for mission or business processes, and for systems, if needed.
        Procedures describe how the policies or controls are implemented and can be
        directed at the individual or role that is the object of the procedure. Procedures
        can be documented in system security and privacy plans or in one or more separate
        documents. Events that may precipitate an update to media protection policy
        and procedures include assessment or audit findings, security incidents or
        breaches, or changes in applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations,
        policies, standards, and guidelines. Simply restating controls does not constitute

        controls to restrict the use of system media. Agencies may restrict the use
        of portable storage devices, for example, by using physical cages on workstations
        to prohibit access to certain external ports or disabling or removing the
        ability to insert, read, or write to such devices. Agencies may also limit
        the use of portable storage devices to only approved devices, including devices
        provided by the agency, devices provided by other approved agencies, and devices
        that are not personally owned. Finally, agencies may restrict the use of portable
        storage devices based on the type of device, such as by prohibiting the use
        of writeable, portable storage devices and implementing this restriction by
        disabling or removing the capability to write to such devices. Requiring identifiable

      description: 'Discussion: Split tunneling is the process of allowing a remote
        user or device to establish a nonremote connection with a system and simultaneously
        communicate via some other connection to a resource in an external network.
        This method of network access enables a user to access remote devices and
        simultaneously, access uncontrolled networks. Split tunneling might be desirable
        by remote users to communicate with local system resources, such as printers
        or file servers. However, split tunneling can facilitate unauthorized external
        connections, making the system vulnerable to attack and to exfiltration of
        organizational information. Split tunneling can be prevented by disabling
        configuration settings that allow such capability in remote devices and by
        preventing those configuration settings from being configurable by users.
        Prevention can also be achieved by the detection of split tunneling (or of
        configuration settings that allow split tunneling) in the remote device, and
        by prohibiting the connection if the remote device is using split tunneling.
        A virtual private network (VPN) can be used to securely provision a split
        tunnel. A securely provisioned VPN includes locking connectivity to exclusive,
        managed, and named environments, or to a specific set of pre-approved addresses,
        without user control.

        \ servers, notebook computers, and mobile devices. Malicious code includes\
        \ viruses, worms, Trojan horses, and spyware. Malicious code can also be encoded\
        \ in various formats contained within compressed or hidden files or hidden\
        \ in files using techniques such as steganography. Malicious code can be inserted\
        \ into systems in a variety of ways, including by electronic mail, the World\
        \ Wide Web, and portable storage devices. \nMalicious code protection mechanisms\
        \ include both signature- and nonsignature-based technologies. Nonsignature-based\
        \ detection mechanisms include artificial intelligence techniques that use\
        \ heuristics to detect, analyze, and describe the characteristics or behavior\
        \ of malicious code and to provide controls against such code for which signatures\
        \ do not yet exist or for which existing signatures may not be effective.\
        \ Malicious code for which active signatures do not yet exist or may be ineffective\
        \ includes polymorphic malicious code (i.e., code that changes signatures\
        \ when it replicates). Nonsignature-based mechanisms also include reputation-based\
        \ technologies. In addition to the above technologies, pervasive configuration\
        \ management, comprehensive software integrity controls, and anti-exploitation\
        \ software may be effective in preventing the execution of unauthorized code.\
        \ Malicious code may be present in commercial off-the-shelf software as well\
        \ as custom-built software and could include logic bombs, backdoors, and other\
        \ types of attacks that could affect organizational mission and business functions.\
        \ \nIn situations where malicious code cannot be detected by detection methods\
        \ or technologies, organizations rely on other types of controls, including\
        \ secure coding practices, configuration management and control, trusted procurement\
        \ processes, and monitoring practices to ensure that software does not perform\
        \ functions other than the functions intended. Organizations may determine\
        \ that, in response to the detection of malicious code, different actions\
        \ may be warranted. For example, organizations can define actions in response\
        \ to malicious code detection during periodic scans, the detection of malicious\
        \ downloads, or the detection of maliciousness when attempting to open or\
        \ execute files. \nRelated Controls:AC-4, AC-19, CM-3, CM-8, IR-4, MA-3, MA-4,\

        assurance. Therefore, it is important that security and privacy programs collaborate
        on the development of maintenance policy and procedures. Security and privacy
        program policies and procedures at the organization level are preferable,
        in general, and may obviate the need for mission- or system-specific policies
        and procedures. The policy can be included as part of the general security
        and privacy policy or be represented by multiple policies that reflect the
        complex nature of organizations. Procedures can be established for security
        and privacy programs, for mission or business processes, and for systems,
        if needed. Procedures describe how the policies or controls are implemented
        and can be directed at the individual or role that is the object of the procedure.
        Procedures can be documented in system security and privacy plans or in one
        or more separate documents. Events that may precipitate an update to maintenance
        policy and procedures assessment or audit findings, security incidents or
        breaches, or changes in applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations,
        policies, standards, and guidelines. Simply restating controls does not constitute

        assurance. Therefore, it is important that security and privacy programs collaborate
        on the development of risk assessment policy and procedures. Security and
        privacy program policies and procedures at the organization level are preferable,
        in general, and may obviate the need for mission- or system-specific policies
        and procedures. The policy can be included as part of the general security
        and privacy policy or be represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex
        nature of organizations. Procedures can be established for security and privacy
        programs, for mission or business processes, and for systems, if needed. Procedures
        describe how the policies or controls are implemented and can be directed
        at the individual or role that is the object of the procedure. Procedures
        can be documented in system security and privacy plans or in one or more separate
        documents. Events that may precipitate an update to risk assessment policy
        and procedures include assessment or audit findings, security incidents or
        breaches, or changes in laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies,

      description: "Discussion: Not all system components, functions, or services\
        \ necessarily require significant protections. For example, criticality analysis\
        \ is a key tenet of supply chain risk management and informs the prioritization\
        \ of protection activities. The identification of critical system components\
        \ and functions considers applicable laws, executive orders, regulations,\
        \ directives, policies, standards, system functionality requirements, system\
        \ and component interfaces, and system and component dependencies. Systems\
        \ engineers conduct a functional decompositionof a system to identify mission-critical\
        \ functions and components. The functional decomposition includes the identification\
        \ of organizational missions supported by the system, decomposition into the\
        \ specific functions to perform those missions, and traceability to the hardware,\
        \ software, and firmware components that implement those functions, including\
        \ when the functions are shared by many components within and external to\
        \ the system. \nThe operational environment of a system or a system component\
        \ may impact the criticality, including the connections to and dependencies\
        \ on cyber-physical systems, devices, system-of- systems, and outsourced IT\
        \ services. System components that allow unmediated access to critical system\
        \ components or functions are considered critical due to the inherent vulnerabilities\
        \ that such components create. Component and function criticality are assessed\
        \ in terms of the impact of a component or function failure on the organizational\
        \ missions that are supported by the system that contains the components and\
        \ functions. \nCriticality analysis is performed when an architecture or design\
        \ is being developed, modified, or upgraded. If such analysis is performed\
        \ early in the system development life cycle, organizations may be able to\
        \ modify the system design to reduce the critical nature of these components\
        \ and functions, such as by adding redundancy or alternate paths into the\
        \ system design. Criticality analysis can also influence the protection measures\
        \ required by development contractors. In addition to criticality analysis\
        \ for systems, system components, and system services, criticality analysis\
        \ of information is an important consideration. Such analysis is conducted\
