        operation in the event of exceptional events (e.g. prolonged power outage,

        downtime.


        The time limits for self-sufficient operation provide for at least 48 hours
        in the event of a failure of the external power supply.


        For a self-sufficient operation during a heat period, the highest outside
        temperatures measured to date within a radius of at least 50 km around the
        locations of the premises and buildings have been determined with a safety
        margin of 3 K. The security requirements stipulate that the permissible operating
        and environmental parameters of the cooling supply must also be observed on
        at least five consecutive days with these outside temperatures including the
        safety margin (cf. PS-06 Protection against failure of the supply facilities).


        If water is taken from a river for air conditioning, it is determined at which
        water levels and water temperatures the air conditioning can be maintained
        for how long.


        The maximum tolerable downtimes of utility facilities are suitable for meeting
        the availability requirements contained in the service level agreement.

        Premises and buildings in which no data from cloud customers is processed
        or stored (e.g. offices of the Cloud Service Provider, server rooms with system
        components for internal development and test systems) are not subject to this
        criteria area.


        The recognised rules of technology are defined in relevant standards, e.g.

        substances) as well as an incorrect conception of the bandwidth or energy
        supply.

        Measures to prevent the failure of the technical supply facilities are e.g.
        power supply, cooling, fire-fighting technology, telecommunications, security
        technology, etc.


        Cloud Service Providers can ensure that all data remains undamaged in the
        event of a power failure by shutting down servers following a defined procedure.


        Power supply and telecommunications lines can be protected against interruption,
        interference, damage and eavesdropping by e.g. underground supply via different

        processes. Access to the production environment requires two-factor or multi-factor
        authentication. Within the production environment, user authentication takes
        place through passwords, digitally signed certificates or procedures that
        achieve at least an equivalent level of security. If digitally signed certificates
        are used, administration is carried out in accordance with the Guideline for
