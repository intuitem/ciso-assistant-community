        or responsibilities to more than one person, organisation or elements of a
        process, but is placed in a position where they cannot do justice to all.
        This includes, for example, when an individual's vested interests or concerns
        are inconsistent with organisational outcomes, or when an official has conflicting
        responsibilities. In the context of the C&A process, a conflict of interest
        can occur when an individual has multiple roles, such as being both the system
        owner and the Accreditation Authority.

        \ agency risk and the cost, effort and benefit of the audit.\_ Sufficient\
        \ evidence should be obtained to allow the auditor to be able to draw reasonable\
        \ conclusions on which to base the audit opinion.\_ For evidence to be deemed\
        \ sufficient, the following aspects should be considered:\nMateriality.\_\
        \ Materiality is the threshold where any distorted, missing and incorrect\
        \ information is likely to have an impact on the risk and security of a system.\_\
        \ Where it becomes clear that there are material deficiencies in the evidence\
        \ presented more substantive tests may be required or the audit suspended\
        \ until corrective action has been taken by the agency.\nRisk assessment:\
        \ It is almost impossible to validate every risk identification and selection\
        \ of risk treatments.\_ For larger systems a more practical approach may be\
        \ to validate the identification and treatment of major risks and use sampling\
        \ techniques for the balance.\nEconomy: Before gathering or requesting additional\
        \ audit evidence, it is important to consider whether or not it is feasible\
        \ or cost-effective to generate this evidence against the benefits, assessed\
        \ value and time required.\n"

        determine its risk appetite and associated risk acceptance, risk avoidance
        and risk tolerance thresholds. Risk owners must be identified.

        is a government-wide program intended to provide a standardised approach to
        security assessment, authorisation, and continuous monitoring for cloud products
        and services. This approach is designed to provide reusable cloud security
        assessments in order to reduce cost, resource and time. In addition it was
        intended to minimise cybersecurity risk for Federal Agencies as they move
        operations to the cloud, provide consistent baseline security policies and
        streamline the procurement process.

        Security Assessment: The security assessment process uses a standardised set
        of requirements in accordance with FISMA using a baseline set of NIST 800-53
        controls with additional controls specific to cloud deployments, in order
        to grant security authorisations. Cryptographic elements are governed by the
        FIPS 140-2 standards.

        Leveraging and Authorisation: Federal agencies view security authorisation
        packages in the FedRAMP repository and leverage the security authorisation
        packages to grant a security authorisation at their own agency.

        Ongoing Assessment & Authorisation: Once an authorisation is granted, ongoing
        assessment and authorisation activities are required to maintain the security
        authorisation.

        detail as well as risk area coverage. Selection and usage of reports should
        be considered in the context of the intended service/system business and information
        value.Understanding the business and technical risk context will drive the
        size and depth of a risk assessment, and the associated assurance process.
        Though even a lighter-weight risk assurance process will follow the C&A process
        model, such that the CE or authorised delegate is still formally accountable
        and responsible.Re-use of assessments completed by other agencies is encouraged,
        noting the business or information value context may differ. To assist agencies
        and promote efficiency, the Government Chief Digital Officer (GCDO) facilitates
        the sharing and re-use of existing cloud assessment materials among agencies.

        Broadcast domains: Broadcasts exist in every network. \_Many applications\
        \ and network operations require broadcasts to function correctly; therefore,\
        \ it is not possible to eliminate them completely. \_In the same way that\
        \ avoiding failure domains involves clearly de\uFB01ning boundaries, broadcast\
        \ domains should have clear boundaries and include an optimal number of devices\
        \ to minimise the negative impact of broadcasts.\nMAC unicast \uFB02ooding:\
        \ Some switches limit unicast frame forwarding to ports that are associated\
        \ with the speci\uFB01c unicast address. \_However, when frames arrive at\
        \ a destination MAC address that is not recorded in the MAC table, they are\
        \ \uFB02ooded out of the switch ports in the same VLAN except for the port\
        \ that received the frame. \_This behaviour is called unknown MAC unicast\
        \ \uFB02ooding.\nBecause this type of \uFB02ooding causes excessive traf\uFB01\
        c on all the switch ports, network interface cards (NIC) must contend with\

        \ technique that allows IP traf\uFB01c to be propagated from one source to\
        \ a multicast group that is identi\uFB01ed by a single IP and MAC destination-group\
        \ address pair. \_Similar to unicast \uFB02ooding and broadcasting, multicast\
        \ frames are \uFB02ooded out all the switch ports. A robust design allows\
        \ for the containment of multicast frames while allowing them to be functional.\n\
        Dif\uFB01culty in management and support: Traf\uFB01c \uFB02ows can be difficult\
        \ to identify in a poorly designed network. \_This can make support, maintenance,\
        \ and problem resolution time-consuming and difficult as well as creating\
        \ security risks.\nPossible security vulnerabilities: A switched network that\
        \ has been designed with little attention to security requirements at the\
        \ access layer can compromise the integrity of the entire network.\nCriteria-based\
        \ segmentation: Pre-define rules to establish perimeters and create new segments\
        \ in order to reduce unnecessary redesign and future administrative overheads.\
        \ \_Examples of criteria are trust level (e.g., external public segment, staff\
        \ segment, server segment, database segment, suppliers segment, etc.), organisational\
        \ unit (e.g., Operations, Service Desk, Outreach, etc.), and combinations\
        \ (e.g., external public access).\n"

        When eavesdropping takes place on the Bluetooth communications between paired

        Pairing Eavesdropping: is an attack where Bluetooth devices are forced to
        re-pair in the open and this allow the pairing process to be eavesdropped.

        Secure Simple Pairing Attacks: During the Bluetooth pairing process, an attacker
        with physical proximity can gain unauthorised access via an adjacent network,
        and intercept traffic and send forged pairing messages between two vulnerable
        Bluetooth devices.

      description: "Specific threats and vulnerabilities in the use of RFID technologies\
        \ include:\nLegitimate data-mining: This risk predates the use of RFID technology,\
        \ but the volume of data provided by RFID tags, loyalty cards, Near Field\
        \ Communication (NFC) for bank cards and for electronic wallets increases\
        \ the risk. Some data collection methods keep to ethical use of data-mining\
        \ techniques to discover the characteristics and habits of an individual or\
        \ an organisation. This can pose a business intelligence risk. At times, however,\
        \ this may challenge the bounds of privacy and data ownership. For example,\
        \ customer loyalty card data used to discover medical information about an\
        \ individual or RFID tags to track shipments or deliveries to an organisation\
        \ by a competitor.\_\nEavesdropping and Data theft: This risk is similar to\
        \ the data-mining risk but employs unethical and possibly illegal methods\
        \ of data collection or obtaining data for nefarious or malicious purposes.\
        \ RFID tags are designed to broadcast information and data theft by easily\
        \ concealable RFID scanners is technically trivial. Data theft can pose a\
        \ risk to business processes.\nSkimming: Occurs when an unauthorised reader\
        \ gains access to data stored on a token. This type of attack is particularly\
        \ dangerous where contactless access or payment cards are used.\nRelay Attacks:\
        \ Relay attacks use eavesdropping to intercept legitimate tag/reader transmissions\
        \ and relay these to a device at some distance from the legitimate tag. The\
        \ device can then behave as the genuine tag. Again this type of attack is\
        \ particularly dangerous where contactless access or payment cards are used.\n\
        Insert Attacks: Insert attacks insert system commands where normal data is\
        \ expected and relies on a lack of data validation. It is possible that a\
        \ tag can have legitimate data replaced by a malicious command.\nTag Cloning:\
        \ Clones replicate the functionality of legitimate tags and can be used to\
        \ access controlled areas, abuse private data, or make an unauthorised electronic\
        \ transaction. Tag authentication using a challenge-response protocol is a\
        \ defence against cloning as the information that attackers can obtain through\
        \ the air interface (such as by eavesdropping) is insufficient to provide\
        \ a legitimate response. The design of the tag can also incorporate measures\
        \ at the circuit manufacturing stage to protect tags from duplication by reverse\
        \ engineering.\nData corruption: Most RFID tags are rewritable by design.\
        \ This feature may be locked (turning the tag into a write-once, read-many\
        \ device) or left active, depending on application and security sensitivity.\
        \ For example, in libraries, the RFID tags are frequently left unlocked for\
        \ the convenience of librarians in reusing the tags on different books or\
        \ to track check-ins and check-outs. If tags are not protected, it creates\
        \ an opportunity for malicious users to overwrite data, typically in the theft\
        \ of high-value goods by marking them as low-value items or in the case of\
        \ weapons monitoring, changing the weapon identification.\nShipment or People\
        \ tracking: While RFID tags are designed to assist in stock control and supply\
        \ chain management, unauthorised tracking of shipments or of people is undesirable\
        \ and may even be dangerous. It is possible to follow individuals carrying\
        \ tags using several techniques, including placing fake readers at building\
        \ access points, deploying unauthorised readers near legitimate readers and\
        \ creating relay points along expected routes.\nTag Blocking: This is a form\
        \ of denial of service by introducing a blocker tag which is designed to simulate\
        \ all possible tags in an allocated range. This causes readers to continually\
        \ perform multiple reads on non-existent and non-responsive tags. Blocker\
        \ tags are sometimes used where privacy or confidentiality are required.\n\
        Denial of Service (DOS): Also known as flooding attacks where a signal is\
        \ flooded with more data than it is designed to handle. Similar in many respects\
        \ to RF Jamming.\n"

        outside of the shielded area. Shielding helps to prevent unauthorised reading,
        access to or modification of the RFID tag data or interfering with RFID readers.
        Shielding can be applied to small, individual items, such as passports and
        credit cards or to large elements such as shipping containers.

      description: Some RFID tags are designed with tamper resistant or tamper-evident
        features to help prevent unauthorised alteration of removal of tags from the
        objects to which they are attached. A simple type of tamper resistance is
        the use of a frangible, or easily broken, antenna. If this tag is removed,
        the connection with the antenna is severed, rendering the tag inoperable.
        Other, more complex types of RFID systems monitor the integrity of objects
        associated with the tags to ensure that the objects have not been compromised,
        altered, or subjected to extreme conditions.

        pose a higher risk as they have the capability to store data. Other tags (classes
        3 to 5) can pose a significant risk to secure spaces.

        introduce a wide range of risks in addition to the risks that already exist
        for agency systems. This may include privacy risks, depending on the use,
        information held and implementation of the RFID system. A risk assessment
        is an essential tool in determining and assessing the range and extent of
        risk and threat in the use of RFID devices.

        terminals and automated teller machines (ATMs)




        EPC


        An Electronic Product Code (EPC) is a universal identifier that gives a unique
        identity to a specific physical object. In most instances, EPCs are encoded
        on RFID tags attached to the object and used for stock tracking and management
        purposes. Many types of assets can be tagged including fixed assets, documents,
        transport containers and clothing items.





        Radio Frequency Identification (RFID)



        RFID is technology utilising electromagnetic or electrostatic coupling in
        the radio frequency (RF) portion of the electromagnetic spectrum to uniquely
        identify an object, item, animal, or person. RFID is increasingly used as
        replacement for bar codes. An RFID system consists of three components: an
        antenna, transceiver (usually the RFID reader) and a transponder (also known
        as a tag).





        Secure Access Module



        A Secure Access Module (or Secure Application Module) is used to enhance the
        security and cryptographic performance of devices. SAMs are commonly found
        in devices needing to perform secure transactions, such as payment terminals.
        It can be used for cryptographic computation and secure authentication against
        smart cards or contactless EMV cards.

        Physically a SAM card can either be a separate component and plugged into
        a device when required or incorporated into an integrated circuit.




        Tag


        The transponder in an RFID system, frequently found attached to an item or
        object to provide electronic identification.

        order to cease information system operations in a planned, orderly and secure

        is consistent and coordinated. Sanitisation is important to eliminate any
        remnant data that could be retrieved by unauthorised parties. These procedures
        include the following:

        A migration plan;

        A decommissioning plan;

        Archiving;

        Safe disposal of equipment and media;

        Robust procedures to manage any residual data and associated risk; and

        and may also be subject to obligations to provide a service, capability or

        contracts and service obligations. Other aspects of system decommission may
        be subject to security, regulatory or legislative requirements. An Agency
        policy will provide a comprehensive approach to system decommissioning from
        the inception of a system, thus facilitating the termination of supply contracts
        and service obligations while managing any risks to the Agency.

        Configure all your email servers to support TLS, regardless of whether they
        are accessible from the internet or private networks only.

        Ensure your email servers present a certificate with suitable cryptographic
        properties and that it is signed by a trusted Certificate Authority.

        Ensure your email servers prefer to use a good cryptographic profile, but
        that lesser cryptographic profiles are supported too. You should support the
        case where TLS is not used at all, if you want to be confident you can receive
        emails from any entity.

        Where possible, consider configuring your email service to force TLS between
        you and organisations you regularly communicate with.

        invariably hampers efforts to identify a specific user and attribute actions
        to a specific person or system. While agencies and users find convenience
        in sharing credentials, doing so is highly risky. Shared credentials can defeat
        accountability and the attribution and non-repudiation principles of access
        control. This is particularly important where administrative access to networks
        and servers or access to classified information is provided through shared

      description: "Agencies deploying a secure wireless network can choose WPA2-Enterprise\
        \ with EAP-Transport Layer Security (EAP-TLS), WPA2-Enterprise with EAP-Tunnelled\
        \ Transport Layer Security (EAP-TTLS) or WPA2-Enterprise with Protected EAP\
        \ (PEAP) to perform mutual authentication.WPA2-Enterprise with EAP-TLS is\
        \ considered one of the most secure EAP methods. With its inclusion in the\
        \ initial release of the WPA2 standard, it enjoys wide support in wireless\
        \ access points and in numerous operating systems such as Microsoft Windows,\
        \ Linux and Apple OS X. EAP-TLS uses a public key infrastructure (PKI) to\
        \ secure communications between devices and a Remote Access Dial In User Service\
        \ (RADIUS) server through the use of X.509 certificates. While EAP-TLS provides\
        \ strong mutual authentication, it requires an agency to have established\
        \ a PKI. This involves either deploying their own certificate authority and\
        \ issuing certificates, or purchasing certificates from a commercial certificate\
        \ authority, for every device that accesses the wireless network. This can\
        \ introduce additional costs and management overheads but the risk and security\
        \ management advantages are significant.The EAP-TTLS/MSCHAPv2, or simply EAP-TTLS,\
        \ method used with WPA2-Enterprise is generally supported through the use\
        \ of third party software. It has support in multiple operating systems including\
        \ Microsoft Windows 7, 8, 10 and Server 2012 but does not have native support\
        \ in earlier versions of Microsoft Windows. EAP-TTLS is different to EAP-TLS\
        \ in that devices do not authenticate to the server when the initial TLS tunnel\
        \ is created. Only the server authenticates to devices. Once the TLS tunnel\
        \ has been created, mutual authentication occurs through the use of another\
        \ EAP method.An advantage of EAP-TTLS over PEAP is that a username is never\
        \ transmitted in the clear outside of the TLS tunnel. Another advantage of\
        \ EAP-TTLS is that it provides support for many legacy EAP methods, while\
        \ PEAP is generally limited to the use of EAP-MSCHAPv2.PEAPv0/EAP-MSCHAPv2,\
        \ or simply PEAP, is the second most widely supported EAP method after EAP-TLS.\
        \ It enjoys wide support in wireless access points and in numerous operating\
        \ systems such as Microsoft Windows, Linux and Apple OS X. PEAP operates in\
        \ a very similar way to EAP-TTLS by creating a TLS tunnel which is used to\
        \ protect another EAP method. PEAP differs from EAP-TTLS in that when the\
        \ EAP-MSCHAPv2 method is used within the TLS tunnel, only the password portion\
        \ is protected and not the username. This may allow an intruder to capture\
        \ the username and replay it with a bogus password in order to lockout the\
        \ user\u2019s account, causing a denial of service for that user. While EAP-MSCHAPv2\
        \ within PEAP is the most common implementation, Microsoft Windows supports\
        \ the use of EAP-TLS within PEAP, known as PEAP-EAP-TLS. This approach is\
        \ very similar in operation to traditional EAP-TLS yet provides increased\
        \ protection, as parts of the certificate that are not encrypted with EAP-TLS\
        \ are encrypted with PEAP-EAP-TLS. The downside to PEAP-EAP-TLS is its support\
        \ is limited to Microsoft products."

        on the RADIUS server. This can minimise the time an intruder has access to
        a wireless network.

        public cloud services:

        Cloud accounts based on identities and authentication from other services
        or systems using identity federation (such as SAML V2.0 or OpenID Connect).

        Cloud identities synchronised from an existing identity system.

        Cloud identities directly provisioned in local cloud service identity stores,
        either manually or through automation following a standard specification such
        as the System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM).

        \ for those actions & decisions.\n\n\n\n\nAccountable Material\n\n\nAccountable\
        \ information, an accountable item or accountable material refers to the accountability\
        \ controls applied to specified information, equipment or materials. Accountable\
        \ information, items or materials are usually uniquely identifiable (usually\
        \ a serial or identification number) and are tracked from acquisition or creation\
        \ to final disposal. Safe custody is a fundamental and is achieved through:\n\
        \nis easily to compute;\nwill usually output a significantly different value,\
        \ even for small changes made to the input; and\ncan detect many types of\
        \ data corruptions.\nallocation to a specific individual (issued or responsibility\
        \ designated);\nallocation or designation of responsibility may also require\
        \ a specific briefing related to the handling, care and protection of particular\
        \ types of classified information and COMSEC equipment;\nthe allocation, issue\
        \ or designation being recorded;\nstrict controls over access and movement\
        \ (special handling requirements);\nmaintenance of a register (manual or electronic);\
        \ and\nregular audits to ensure accountability conditions continue to be adhered\
        \ to and any briefings are current.\n\nAs a general rule, accountable information,\
        \ items or materials are afforded physical security protection by specifying\
        \ special handling and accountability conditions. Examples may include cryptographic\
        \ or COMSEC equipment, other high value equipment, money, computers or information\
        \ subject to privacy legislation and regulation. Cryptographic or COMSEC equipment\
        \ and any information classified as CONFIDENTIAL, SECRET or TOP SECRET is\
        \ accountable by definition.\n\n\n\n\nAccountability\n\n\nMost contemporary\
        \ definitions include two key elements:\n\nthe conferring of responsibility\
        \ and authority; and\nthe answering for the use of that authority.\n\nAccountability\
        \ exists when the performance of tasks or functions by an individual or organisation,\
        \ are subject to another\u2019s oversight, direction or request that they\
        \ provide information or justification for their actions.\nAnswering for the\
        \ use of authority means reporting, explaining actions, assuming obligations,\
        \ and submitting to outside or external judgement. \_Having responsibility\
        \ means having the authority to act, the power to control and the freedom\
        \ to decide.\_ It also means that one must behave rationally, reliably and\
        \ consistently in exercising judgement.\n\n\n\n\nAccreditation\n\n\nA procedure\
        \ by which an authoritative body gives formal recognition, approval and acceptance\
        \ of the associated residual security risk with the operation of a system\
        \ and issues a formal approval to operate the system.\n\n\n\n\nAccreditation\
        \ Authority\n\n\nThe authoritative body or individual responsible for systems\
        \ accreditation.\n\n\n\n\nAdaptive Authentication\n\n\nThis varies the level\
        \ or degree of authentication required where unusual login requests occur.\_\
        \ For example, out of normal hours, from an unusual geolocation, from an unknown\
        \ device and so on.\_ When an unusual authentication request is received,\
        \ Adaptive Authentication may request additional credentials such as a one-time\
        \ code provided to a known mobile phone number.\n\n\n\n\nAgency\n\n\nNew Zealand\
        \ Government departments, authorities, agencies or other bodies established\
        \ in relation to public purposes, including departments and authorities staffed\
        \ under the Public Service Act.\n\n\n\n\nAgency Control\n\n\nThis description\
        \ applies where an Agency has direct control of agency information systems\
        \ and data.\_ It follows that Non-Agency Control occurs where direct control\

        \ provide cryptographic functions. HSM\u2019s are usually physically and electronically\
        \ hardened to reduce the possibility of tampering or other interference.\n\
        \n\n\n\nHash\n\n\nA hash is the result of a one-way, cryptographic function\
        \ that converts a data string of any length into a unique fixed-length bit\
        \ string.\_ Typically applied to passwords and messages to protect against\
        \ loss and/or add resistance to attacks.\nHashing algorithms or functions\
        \ are often are designed as a one-way cryptographic transformation so that\
        \ it's impossible to reverse the hash process and reconstitute the original\
        \ string.\nThe values returned by a hash function are variously described\
        \ as hash values, hash codes, digests, or simply hashes.\nOne common use of\
        \ a hash is a data structure called a hash table, widely used in computer\
        \ software for indexing and rapid retrieval of database elements.\nNote that\
        \ a hash is not the same as data encryption although it does utilise cryptographic\
        \ functions.\nSee also Checksum.\n\n\n\n\nHash Value\n\n\nSee Hash.\_ Also\
        \ known as \"message digest\".\n\n\n\n\nHashed Message Authentication Code\
        \ Algorithms\n\n\nIn cryptography, a keyed-hash message authentication code\
        \ (HMAC) is a specific type of message authentication code (MAC) using a cryptographic\
        \ hash function and a cryptographic key.\n\n\n\n\nHigh Assurance\n\n\nHigh\
        \ Assurance is a generic term encompassing Common Criteria Evaluation Assurance\
        \ Levels (EAL) 5, 6 and 7. Alternatively refers to the independent (unrelated)\
        \ ASD High Assurance Evaluation Scheme.\n\n\n\n\nHigh Assurance Cryptography\n\
        \n\nThe U.S. ranks cryptographic products and algorithms through a certification\
        \ programme and categorising the products and algorithms into product types.\
        \ Product types are defined in the US National Information Assurance Glossary\
        \ (CNSSI No. 4009) which defines Type 1 and 2 products, and Type 3 and 4 algorithms.\
        \ Type 1 products are used to protect systems requiring the most stringent\
        \ protection mechanisms.\n\n\n\n\nHigh Assurance Cryptographic Equipment (HACE)\n\
        \n\nThe equivalent to United States Type 1 cryptographic products & equipment.\

        \n\nHybrid Hard Drives\n\n\nNon-volatile magnetic media that use a cache to\
        \ increase read and write speeds and reduce boot time.\_ The cache is normally\
        \ flash memory media or battery backed RAM.\n\n\n\n\nIncident Response Plan\n\
        \n\nA plan for responding to information security incidents as defined by\
        \ the individual agency.\n\n\n\n\nIdentity and Access Management\n\n\nIdentity\
        \ and Access Management (IAM) is a framework of business processes, policies\
        \ and technologies that enable and support the management of electronic or\
        \ digital identities, authorisation, privileges and access to organisational\
        \ resources.\nIdentity management deals with attributes related to a user\
        \ (including people, machines, devices and systems).\_Access Management applies\
        \ organisation processes, policies and security to enable and manage access.\_\
        The two aspects are highly interdependent and are most effectively managed\
        \ conjointly.\_An IAM framework is a key element in Privileged Access Management\
        \ (PAM) and Zero Trust architectures.\n\n\n\n\nImage persistence / Image retention\n\
        \n\nLCD/LED/OLED and plasma technologies can be susceptible to persistence\
        \ or retention of an image or \u201Cghost\u201D image on the screen.\_ This\
        \ can also led to screen burn-in, as can occur in traditional CRT monitors.\n\
        \n\n\n\nIndirect Agency Control\n\n\nIn relation to the NZISM, Indirect agency\
        \ control is when information, services or operations are not under the direct\
        \ control of the agency. This may be through outsourcing of, ICT management\
        \ or services, use of third party facilities such as data centre co-locations,\
