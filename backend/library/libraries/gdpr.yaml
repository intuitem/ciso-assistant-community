        on an unprecedented scale in order to pursue their activities. Natural persons
        increasingly make personal information available publicly and globally. Technology
        has transformed both the economy and social life, and should further facilitate

        across the Union, legal uncertainty or a widespread public perception that
        there are significant risks to the protection of natural persons, in particular
        with regard to online activity. Differences in the level of protection of
        the rights and freedoms of natural persons, in particular the right to the
        protection of personal data, with regard to the processing of personal data
        in the Member States may prevent the free flow of personal data throughout
        the Union. Those differences may therefore constitute an obstacle to the pursuit
        of economic activities at the level of the Union, distort competition and
        impede authorities in the discharge of their responsibilities under Union
        law. Such a difference in levels of protection is due to the existence of
        differences in the implementation and application of Directive 95/46/EC.

        movement of personal data within the internal market, a Regulation is necessary
        to provide legal certainty and transparency for economic operators, including
        micro, small and medium-sized enterprises, and to provide natural persons
        in all Member States with the same level of legally enforceable rights and
        obligations and responsibilities for controllers and processors, to ensure
        consistent monitoring of the processing of personal data, and equivalent sanctions
        in all Member States as well as effective cooperation between the supervisory
        authorities of different Member States. The proper functioning of the internal
        market requires that the free movement of personal data within the Union is
        not restricted or prohibited for reasons connected with the protection of
        natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data. To take account
        of the specific situation of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises, this
        Regulation includes a derogation for organisations with fewer than 250 employees
        with regard to record-keeping. In addition, the Union institutions and bodies,
        and Member States and their supervisory authorities, are encouraged to take
        account of the specific needs of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises
        in the application of this Regulation. The notion of micro, small and medium-sized
        enterprises should draw from Article 2 of the Annex to Commission Recommendation
        2003/361/EC (1).

        concerning an identified or identifiable natural person. Personal data which
        have undergone pseudonymisation, which could be attributed to a natural person
        by the use of additional information should be considered to be information
        on an identifiable natural person. To determine whether a natural person is
        identifiable, account should be taken of all the means reasonably likely to
        be used, such as singling out, either by the controller or by another person
        to identify the natural person directly or indirectly. To ascertain whether
        means are reasonably likely to be used to identify the natural person, account
        should be taken of all objective factors, such as the costs of and the amount
        of time required for identification, taking into consideration the available
        technology at the time of the processing and technological developments. The
        principles of data protection should therefore not apply to anonymous information,
        namely information which does not relate to an identified or identifiable
        natural person or to personal data rendered anonymous in such a manner that
        the data subject is not or no longer identifiable. This Regulation does not
        therefore concern the processing of such anonymous information, including

        subject should also be allowed to receive personal data concerning him or
        her which he or she has provided to a controller in a structured, commonly
        used, machine-readable and interoperable format, and to transmit it to another
        controller. Data controllers should be encouraged to develop interoperable
        formats that enable data portability. That right should apply where the data
        subject provided the personal data on the basis of his or her consent or the
        processing is necessary for the performance of a contract. It should not apply
        where processing is based on a legal ground other than consent or contract.
        By its very nature, that right should not be exercised against controllers
        processing personal data in the exercise of their public duties. It should
        therefore not apply where the processing of the personal data is necessary
        for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject
        or for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in
        the exercise of an official authority vested in the controller. The data subject's
        right to transmit or receive personal data concerning him or her should not
        create an obligation for the controllers to adopt or maintain processing systems
        which are technically compatible. Where, in a certain set of personal data,
        more than one data subject is concerned, the right to receive the personal
        data should be without prejudice to the rights and freedoms of other data
        subjects in accordance with this Regulation. Furthermore, that right should
        not prejudice the right of the data subject to obtain the erasure of personal
        data and the limitations of that right as set out in this Regulation and should,
        in particular, not imply the erasure of personal data concerning the data
        subject which have been provided by him or her for the performance of a contract
        to the extent that and for as long as the personal data are necessary for
        the performance of that contract. Where technically feasible, the data subject
        should have the right to have the personal data transmitted directly from
        one controller to another.

        services competent for social security matters, or for public health, for
        example in the case of contact tracing for contagious diseases or in order

        physical integrity or life, if the data subject is incapable of giving consent.
        In the absence of an adequacy decision, Union or Member State law may, for
        important reasons of public interest, expressly set limits to the transfer
        of specific categories of data to a third country or an international organisation.
        Member States should notify such provisions to the Commission. Any transfer
        to an international humanitarian organisation of personal data of a data subject
        who is physically or legally incapable of giving consent, with a view to accomplishing
        a task incumbent under the Geneva Conventions or to complying with international
        humanitarian law applicable in armed conflicts, could be considered to be
        necessary for an important reason of public interest or because it is in the
        vital interest of the data subject.

      description: The processing of personal data for archiving purposes in the public
        interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes
        should be subject to appropriate safeguards for the rights and freedoms of
        the data subject pursuant to this Regulation. Those safeguards should ensure
        that technical and organisational measures are in place in order to ensure,
        in particular, the principle of data minimisation. The further processing
        of personal data for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific
        or historical research purposes or statistical purposes is to be carried out
        when the controller has assessed the feasibility to fulfil those purposes
        by processing data which do not permit or no longer permit the identification
        of data subjects, provided that appropriate safeguards exist (such as, for
        instance, pseudonymisation of the data). Member States should provide for
        appropriate safeguards for the processing of personal data for archiving purposes
        in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical
        purposes. Member States should be authorised to provide, under specific conditions
        and subject to appropriate safeguards for data subjects, specifications and
        derogations with regard to the information requirements and rights to rectification,
        to erasure, to be forgotten, to restriction of processing, to data portability,
        and to object when processing personal data for archiving purposes in the
        public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical
        purposes. The conditions and safeguards in question may entail specific procedures
        for data subjects to exercise those rights if this is appropriate in the light
        of the purposes sought by the specific processing along with technical and
        organisational measures aimed at minimising the processing of personal data
        in pursuance of the proportionality and necessity principles. The processing
        of personal data for scientific purposes should also comply with other relevant
        legislation such as on clinical trials.

      description: By coupling information from registries, researchers can obtain
        new knowledge of great value with regard to widespread medical conditions
        such as cardiovascular disease, cancer and depression. On the basis of registries,
        research results can be enhanced, as they draw on a larger population. Within
        social science, research on the basis of registries enables researchers to
        obtain essential knowledge about the long-term correlation of a number of
        social conditions such as unemployment and education with other life conditions.
        Research results obtained through registries provide solid, high-quality knowledge
        which can provide the basis for the formulation and implementation of knowledge-based
        policy, improve the quality of life for a number of people and improve the
        efficiency of social services. In order to facilitate scientific research,
        personal data can be processed for scientific research purposes, subject to
        appropriate conditions and safeguards set out in Union or Member State law.

        development and demonstration, fundamental research, applied research and
