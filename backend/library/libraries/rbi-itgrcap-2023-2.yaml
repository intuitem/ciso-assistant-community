      annotation: RBI's rules state that IT Governance is about ensuring tech supports
        business goals (strategic alignment), minimizing IT threats (risk management),
        efficiently using IT assets (resource management), tracking IT's effectiveness
        (performance management), and having backup plans for emergencies (Business
        Continuity/ Disaster Recovery Management), ensuring stability for customers
        and the institution.

        (an IT Governance Framework) for managing technology. This framework ensures
        IT supports business goals, manages technology risks (like cyberattacks),
        and efficiently uses resources. For example, setting up a committee of senior
        leaders to review security policies is part of this framework.

        (like who makes decisions about technology and security) to ensure its IT
        supports its main business goals, such as securely launching a new mobile
        app or protecting customer data. The actionable step is establishing committees
        and policies that define responsibilities for IT control and strategy, making
        sure technology decisions help the bank succeed and stay compliant.

        clear rules and committees to watch over IT operations and cyber defenses,
        making sure people are held accountable and risks, like data breaches or system
        failures, are actively minimized.

      annotation: RBI guidelines mandate that REs regularly check their IT setup for
        weaknesses and potential problems (like a hacking threat or a system failure).
        This means regularly assessing all IT risks, both those built into the system
        (inherent) and those that might pop up (potential), to ensure technology risks
        are managed just like any other business risk.

      annotation: This means the top leadership (the Board) must officially approve
        all major plans and rules for technology, data protection, keeping operations
        running during a crisis (like a system failure), and handling cyberattacks.
        For example, they must sign off on the plan for securing customer data or
        the steps to recover systems after a cyber incident. This ensures accountability
        and senior oversight for managing critical risks.

        committee, overseen by the Board, is responsible for setting the technology
        direction and ensuring IT investments support the business goals and manage
        risks, much like a general plans a campaign before deploying resources.

        perspectives and effective governance over technology and cybersecurity. This
        means that important decisions about the RE's digital safety and strategy
        require approval from a group of at least three high-level leaders, preventing
        any single person from dominating critical IT risk decisions.

        board member with deep knowledge in IT management, like a CEO or CTO from
        another tech company. This ensures that IT decisions, such as approving major
        system upgrades or cybersecurity policies, are guided by expert, unbiased
        advice for better technology strategy and risk oversight.

        or IT staff) must have the proper technical skills and knowledge to understand,
        govern, and protect the organization's systems and data. For example, a committee
        member needs to understand what cybersecurity risks are to approve adequate
        controls.

        once every three months. This ensures continuous review of the institution's
        technology strategy, IT risks, and security posture. For example, they must
        regularly check if cybersecurity defenses are adequate or if new digital projects
        align with business goals. Regular meetings prevent major issues from being
        overlooked.

        helping the institution use tech effectively and manage risks, similar to
        creating a roadmap for all major future technology projects and investments.

        to directly support and help achieve the company's main business goals (overall
        strategy). For example, if the business goal is rapid digital customer service
        expansion, the IT strategy must focus on securing necessary cloud infrastructure
        and developing user-friendly apps. The actionable step is creating a formal
        IT plan that clearly shows how every major technology project contributes
        to a specific business objective.

        in business operations.
      annotation: The RBI Master Direction ensures that REs and NBFCs leverage IT
        for productivity and efficiency by mandating a formal IT Governance Framework.
        This means having things like a Board-level IT Strategy Committee and regular
        risk assessments (like checking for system weaknesses or having a backup plan
        if systems fail) to manage the risks that come with using technology, ensuring
        IT benefits the business safely.

      annotation: To ensure technology aligns with business goals, regulated entities
        must form an IT Steering Committee. This committee is made up of senior leaders
        from both the IT department and core business units (like finance or operations).
        Their job is to oversee major IT projects, manage risks, and make sure IT
        spending supports the overall business strategy. For example, if the RE wants
        to launch a new mobile app, this committee decides on the priority, budget,
        and resources.

        escrow, which is like a safe deposit box for the code, held by a neutral third
        party. This ensures that if the vendor fails or goes out of business, the

        This document confirms the software is safe and free from known flaws, harmful
        code (malware), and secret data leaks (covert channels). For example, if your

      annotation: This means the plan for keeping operations running during and after
        major disruptions (BCP/DR) must use top industry standards. The goal is to
        lower the chance or severity of incidents, like a data center outage or cyber
        attack, and ensure business keeps moving. Crucially, this plan must be reviewed
        and updated regularly based on new risks or technology changes.

      annotation: The RE must have a backup plan (BCP) and recovery steps (DR) ready
        so that if a cyber-attack or other major issue happens, essential services,
        like online REing or security systems, can quickly and safely get back up

        ensure we can restore normal service fast. This is required under the RBI
        Master Direction on IT Governance.

        must be rerun successfully before the next scheduled cycle to guarantee that
        the organization can reliably recover all systems and data, minimizing downtime
