        \ \n\u0387  Identify Objectives: Clearly define what the organisation aims\

        \ against supply chain attacks, ensuring compliance with regulations, and\
        \ maintaining business continuity. \n\u0387  Develop a Strategy: Outline a\
        \ high-level strategy that aligns with the organisation's overall cybersecurity\
        \ and business strategies. This should include risk assessment, risk mitigation,\
        \ and continuous monitoring plans. \n\nEngage Stakeholders \n\u0387  Identify\
        \ Stakeholders: Determine who the key stakeholders are, including executives,\
        \ IT, procurement, legal, and compliance teams. \n\u0387  Stakeholder Involvement:\
        \ Engage stakeholders early in the process to ensure their input and buy-in.\
        \ This can be done through workshops, meetings, and regular updates. \n\n\
        Establish Policies and Processes \n\u0387  Develop Policies: Create comprehensive\

        \  Conduct Risk Assessments: Regularly assess risks associated with the supply\
        \ chain, including potential vulnerabilities and threats. \n\u0387  Mitigate\
        \ Risks: Develop and implement risk mitigation strategies based on the assessment\
        \ results. This might include diversifying suppliers, enhancing security controls,\
        \ and establishing contingency plans. \n\nContinuous Monitoring and Improvement\
        \ \n\u0387  Monitor Continuously: Implement continuous monitoring of the supply\
        \ chain to detect and respond to new risks promptly. This includes monitoring\
        \ supplier performance and compliance. \n\u0387  Review and Improve: Regularly\
        \ review the effectiveness of the C-SCRM program and make improvements as\
        \ needed. This should include feedback from stakeholders and lessons learned\
        \ from incidents. \n\nTraining and Awareness \nEducate Employees: Provide\
        \ training and awareness programs for employees to understand their roles\
        \ in C-SCRM. This includes recognising supply chain risks and following established\
