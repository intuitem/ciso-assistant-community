description: One of the objectives of Regulation (EU) 2022/2554 on digital operational
  resilience for the financial sector (DORA) is to set out uniform requirements for
  the security of network and information systems of companies and organisations operating
  in the financial sector. It thus creates a regulatory framework on digital operational
  resilience, whereby all financial entities need to make sure they can withstand,
  respond to, and recover from all types of ICT-related disruptions and threats. These
  requirements are homogenous across the EU, with the aim of preventing and mitigating
  cyber threats.
