        oxide (N2O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), sulphur hexafluoride
        (SF6) and nitrogen trifluoride (NF3).

        (b) ESRS E3 Water and marine resources which addresses water consumption,
        in particular in areas at water risk, water recycling and storage. This also
        includes the responsible management of marine resources, including the nature
        and quantity of marine resources-related commodities (such as gravels, deep-sea
        minerals, seafood) used by the undertaking. This Standard covers the negative
        impacts, in terms of pollution of water and marine resources, including microplastics,
        generated by such activities.

        (c) ESRS E4 Biodiversity and ecosystems which addresses ecosystems and species.
        Pollution as a direct impact driver of biodiversity loss is addressed by this
        Standard.

        (d) ESRS E5 Resource use and circular economy which addresses, in particular,
        the transition away from extraction of non-renewable resources and the implementation
        of practices that prevent waste generation, including pollution generated
        by waste.'

        Such system brings multiple environmental benefits, in particular, the reduction
        of material and energy consumption and emissions into the air (greenhouse
        gas emissions or other pollution), the limitation of water withdrawals and
        discharges and the regeneration of nature limiting the impact on biodiversity.
