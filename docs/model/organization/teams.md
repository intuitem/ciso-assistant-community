# Teams

**Teams** in CISO Assistant are used to group users who work together on the same security activities, such as risk assessments, compliance programs, or audits.&#x20;

Each team has a **Team Leader**, optional **Deputies**, and **Members**, making it easy to reflect real-world responsibilities and delegation. A team can also have a dedicated **team email address** for shared communications. Teams centralize ownership, collaboration, and notifications by allowing CISO Assistant to automatically reach the right people based on their role within the team.&#x20;

Tasks, assessments, assets, applied controls, etc., can be assigned to teams, in the same way as to users.
