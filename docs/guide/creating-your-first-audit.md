How to create a compliance assessment
{% endembed %}

1. After creating the perimeter, we'll have to import a **framework**, for example **ISO/IEC 27001:2022.**
2. Once it is imported, we can now create the **compliance assessment** (ISO/IEC 27001:2022 is auto-selected as it is the only imported framework).
3. You can edit it if needed, or go directly into the assessment. Each **requirement** has a <mark style="color:purple;">To do</mark> status by default.
4. Finally, we can select a requirement and start its assessment by adding applied controls or evidences and update its status to complete the progress bars.
