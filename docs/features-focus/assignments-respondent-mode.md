# Assignments / respondent mode

This feature is intended for organisations who wish to rely on a single audit where multiple users or teams will collaborate by responding to their specific sections (one or multiple requirements).

The feature flag can be enabled from Extra/Settings/Feature flags:

Once the feature flag is enabled, the design is as follows:

* an analyst (or higher role) starts an audit
* through the assignment management, we assign a group of requirements to one or multiple users or teams

* the assignments can be made to a user or a team, over one or multiple requirements

* the assignees need just the `respondent` role on the domain to interact with their assigned sections, and they can do that directly from the respondent view

* when `respondent` users sign it, they get automatically redirected to the dedicated page. Users can find it later on the side nav bar

* Users will see their assigned sections of all the audits organised by domains and they can interact with it by answering the compliance status, attaching applied controls or evidences directly.
* Keep in mind that `respondent` can create, pick or update applied controls or evidences of the domains, to encourage reusability.
