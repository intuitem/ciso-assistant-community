# Library clean-up

If you want to delete a load library, make sure it's not used anywhere (for framework, that's an audit is not depending on them, for a risk matrix, that a risk assessment is not relying on it, etc.) and head to the loaded libraries section of your libraries (Governance/Libraries).

If the item is not used, it will show as "deletable" as below:
