* Lose your phone
* Uninstall your authenticator app
* Cannot access your authenticator app for any reason

* Each recovery code can only be used once
* Never share your recovery codes with anyone
* Consider storing a copy both digitally (in a password manager) and physically (printed in a secure location)
