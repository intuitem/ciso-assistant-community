# Library workbench

The convert-library.py script can be used to transform an Excel file to a CISO Assistant library.

Have a look to the given examples.

## Usage

To launch it, open a shell in a command line, and type:

```bash
python convert_library.py your_library_file.xlsx
```

This will produce a file name your_library_file.yaml

## Format of Excel files

```

    For libraries:
        - library_provider is the entity that provides the reference document (e.g. ANSSI, NIST). 
        - library_packager is the entity that converts the reference document in a library for CISO Assistant (e.g. intuitem). the value "intuitem" for packager is reserved for intuitem. Other packagers are kindly asked to use another descriptive value.
        - library_description shall be sufficiently detailed, and shall contain a link to the reference document.
        - framework_ref_id, framework_name and framework_description are generally identical to their corresponding values for library.

    For requirements:
        If no section_name is given, no upper group is defined, else an upper group (depth 0) with the section name is used.
        The first line is a header, with the following possible fields (* for required):
            - assessable(*): non-empty (e.g x) if this is a requirement
            - depth(*): 1/2/3/... to describe the tree
            - ref_id
            - name
            - description
            - implementation_groups
            - threats
            - reference_controls
            - annotation
            - typical_evidence
            - skip_count: trick for fixing a referential without changing the urns (advanced users)
        The normal tree order shall be respected
        If multiple threats or reference_control are given for a requirements, they shall be separated by blank or comma.
        They shall be prefixed by the id of the corresponding base_urn and a semicolumn.
    For reference controls:
        The first line is a header, with the following possible fields (* for required):
            - ref_id(*)
            - name
            - description
            - category (policy/process/techncial/physical).
            - csf_function (govern/identify/protect/detect/respond/recover).
            - annotation
    For risk matrices:
        The first line is a header, with the following mandatory fields:
            - type: probability/impact/risk.
            - id: a number from 0 to n-1 (depending of the number of objects for a given type)
            - color: empty cells with the desired color. Can be left with no fill.
            - abbreviation: the abbreviation for the object
            - name: name of the object
            - description: description of the object
            - grid: several columns describing the matrix with colors. The colors shall be consistent with the color column.
        The grid shall be aligned with the probability objects, the columns being the impact in order of id, and the content of each cell being the id of the risk.
        This is a topological representation. The display on the screen (transposition, direction of axes) will be managed in the frontend, not in the data model.
    For mappings:
        The first line is a header, with the following possible fields (* for required):
            - source_node_id(*)
            - target_node_id(*)
            - relationship(*)
            - rationale
            - stregth_of_relationship
    A library has a single locale. Translated libraries have the same urns, they are merged during import.
    Dependencies are given as a comma or blank separated list of urns.
```

## Mappings

The `prepare_mapping.py` script can be used to create an Excel file based on two framework libraries in yaml. Once properly filled, this Excel file can be processed by the `convert_library.py` tool to get the resulting mapping library.

## Considerations for URN selection

The recommended format for URNs is: urn:\<packager\>:risk:\<object\>:\<refid\>

Object can be:
- library
- framework
- threat
- reference_control
- matrix
- req_mapping_set
- req_node

For the selection of refid, here are a few considerations:
- It makes sense to have a version of the source document in refid.
- However, this version should be generic enough to allow library updates.
- For example, if the version is v2.0.4, it is probably wise to select v2.0 or even v2. Thus if v2.1.0 is published and it is possible to make a smooth upgrade from v2.0.4, the urn will remain meaningful.
