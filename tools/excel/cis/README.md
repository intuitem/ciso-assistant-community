This script prepares the file to be parsed by the converter:

- copy the downloaded excel sheet from CIS next to this script (for instance CIS_Controls_Version_8.xlsx)
- run the preparation script by passing the filename as 1st argument and your name/entity as a second one for the packager
- run the converter on the prepared excel sheet
- use the resulting yaml in CISO Assistant
