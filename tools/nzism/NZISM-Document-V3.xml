Understanding and using the NZISM"><subsection title="Objective"><paragraph title="1.1.1." ><![CDATA[<p>The New Zealand Information Security Manual details processes and controls essential for the protection of all New Zealand Government information and systems. Controls and processes representing good practice are also provided to enhance the baseline controls. Baseline controls are minimum acceptable levels of controls and are often described as “systems hygiene”.</p>]]></paragraph>
 </subsection>
<subsection title="Context"> <block title="Scope"><paragraph title="1.1.2." ><![CDATA[<p>This manual is intended for use by New Zealand Government departments, agencies and organisations. Crown entities, local government and private sector organisations are also encouraged to use this manual.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="1.1.3." ><![CDATA[<p>This section provides information on how to interpret the content and the layout of content within this manual.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="1.1.4." ><![CDATA[<p>Information that is Official Information or protectively marked UNCLASSIFIED, IN-CONFIDENCE, SENSITIVE or RESTRICTED is subject to a single set of controls in this NZISM.  These are essential or minimum acceptable levels of controls (baseline controls) and have been consolidated into a single set for simplicity, effectiveness and efficiency.  </p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="1.1.5." ><![CDATA[<p>All baseline controls will apply to all government systems, related services and information. In addition, information classified CONFIDENTIAL, SECRET or TOP SECRET has further controls specified in this NZISM.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="1.1.6." ><![CDATA[<p>Where the category “All Classifications” is used to define the scope of rationale and controls in the Manual, it includes any information that is Official Information, UNCLASSIFIED, IN-CONFIDENCE, SENSITIVE, RESTRICTED, CONFIDENTIAL, SECRET, TOP SECRET or any endorsements, releasability markings or other qualifications appended to these categories and classifications.</p>]]></paragraph>

</subsection>
<subsection title="Key definitions"> <block title="Accreditation Authority"><paragraph title="1.1.13." ><![CDATA[<p>The Agency Head is generally the Accreditation Authority for that agency for all systems and related services up to and including those classified RESTRICTED. &nbsp;See also <a title="Roles &amp; responsibilities" href="http://nzism.gcsb.govt.nz/ism-document#Chapter-12255">Chapter 3 – Roles and Responsibilities</a> and <a title="Accreditation framework" href="http://nzism.gcsb.govt.nz/ism-document#Section-12591">Section 4.4 – Accreditation Framework</a>.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="1.1.14." ><![CDATA[<p>Agency heads may choose to delegate this authority to a member of the agency’s executive.  The Agency Head remains accountable for ICT risks accepted and the information security of their agency. </p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="1.1.15." ><![CDATA[<p>In all cases the Accreditation Authority will be at least a senior agency executive who has an appropriate level of understanding of the security risks they are accepting on behalf of the agency.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="1.1.16." ><![CDATA[<p>For multi-national and multi-agency systems the Accreditation Authority is determined by a formal agreement between the parties involved. &nbsp;Consultation with the <a title="Government Chief Digital Officer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://digital.govt.nz/digital-government/leadership/government-functional-leads/government-chief-digital-officer-gcdo/" target="_blank">Office of the Government Chief Digital Officer (GCDO)</a> may also be necessary.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="1.1.17." ><![CDATA[<p>For agencies with systems that process, store or communicate NZEO or information compartmented for national security reasons, the Director-General of the GCSB is the Accreditation Authority irrespective of the classification level of that information<em>.</em></p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Certification and Accreditation Processes"><paragraph title="1.1.18." ><![CDATA[<p>Certification and accreditation of information systems is the fundamental governance process by which the risk owners and agency head derive assurance over the design, implementation and management of information systems and related services provided to or by government agencies. &nbsp; This process is described in detail in <a title="System certification &amp; accreditation" href="http://nzism.gcsb.govt.nz/ism-document#Chapter-12459">Chapter 4 – System Certification and Accreditation</a>.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="1.1.19." ><![CDATA[<p>Certification and Accreditation are two distinct processes.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="1.1.20." ><![CDATA[<p>Certification is the formal assertion that an information system and related services comply with minimum standards and agreed design, including any security requirements.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="1.1.21." ><![CDATA[<p><em>In all cases</em>, certification and the supporting documentation or summary of other evidence will be prepared by, or on behalf of, the host or lead agency.  The certification is then provided to the Accreditation Authority.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="1.1.22." ><![CDATA[<p>Accreditation is the formal authority to operate an information system and related services, and requires the recognition and acceptance of associated risk and residual risks.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="1.1.23." ><![CDATA[<p>A waiver is NOT an exception (see below).  A waiver is the formal acknowledgement that a particular compliance requirement of the NZISM cannot currently be met.  A waiver is granted by the Accreditation Authority on the basis that full compliance with the NZISM is achieved or compensating controls are implemented within a time specified by the Accreditation Authority.  Waivers are valid in the short term only and full accreditation cannot be granted until all conditions of the waiver have been met.  The need for a waiver may occur when specified controls cannot be practically implemented because of technology, resource or other serious limitations.  It is essential that risk is managed through the application of specified conditions.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="1.1.24." ><![CDATA[<p>An exception is NOT a waiver (see preceding paragraph).  An exception is the formal acknowledgement that a requirement of the NZISM cannot be met and that a dispensation from the particular compliance requirement is granted by the Accreditation Authority.  This exception is valid for the term of the Accreditation Certificate or some lesser time as determined by the Accreditation Authority.  This may occur, for example, the system is to be in use for a very short time (usually measured in hours), or the requirement cannot be met and there is no viable alternative.  It is essential that any consequential risk is acknowledged and appropriate measures are taken to manage any increased risk.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="1.1.25." ><![CDATA[<p>The requirements described above are <strong>summarised</strong> in the table below.  Care MUST be taken when using this table as there are numerous endorsements, caveats and releasability instructions in the <a title="Classification system" href="https://protectivesecurity.govt.nz/classification-system/" target="_blank">New Zealand Government Security Classification System</a><a title="NZ Government Security Classification System" href="https://www.protectivesecurity.govt.nz/information-security/security-classification-system-and-handling-requirements/" target="_blank"></a> that may change where the authority for accreditation lies.</p><table class="table-main">

</block>
<block title="Information Security"><paragraph title="1.1.32." ><![CDATA[<p>Although sometimes described as cyber security, Information security is considered a higher level of abstraction than cyber security relating to the protection of information regardless of its form (electronic or physical).  The accepted definition of information security within government is: “measures relating to the confidentiality, availability and integrity of information”.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="1.1.33." ><![CDATA[<p>A number of specialised security areas contribute to information security within government; these include: physical security, personnel security, communications security and information and communications technology (ICT) security along with their associated governance and assurance measures.</p>]]></paragraph>

<block title="Information Systems Governance"><paragraph title="1.1.35." ><![CDATA[<p>An integral part of enterprise governance consists of the leadership and organisational structures and processes to ensure that the agency’s information systems support and sustain the agency’s and Government’s strategies and objectives.  Information Systems Governance is the responsibility of the Agency Head and the Executive team.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Secure Area"><paragraph title="1.1.36." ><![CDATA[<p>In the context of the NZISM a secure area is defined as any area, room, group of rooms, building or installation that processes, stores or communicates information classified CONFIDENTIAL, SECRET, TOP SECRET or any compartmented or caveated information at these classifications.  A secure area may include a SCIF (see below).  The physical security requirements for such areas are specified in the <a title="Security Zones" href="https://www.protectivesecurity.govt.nz/physical-security/understand-the-physical-security-lifecycle/design/apply-good-practices/security/" target="_blank">Protective Security Requirements (PSR) Security Zones</a>.</p>]]></paragraph>

</subsection>
<subsection title="Interpretation of controls"> <block title="Controls language"><paragraph title="1.1.40." ><![CDATA[<p>The definition of controls in this manual is based on language as defined by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)’s Request For Comment (RFC) 2119 to indicate differing degrees of compliance.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Applicability of controls"><paragraph title="1.1.41." ><![CDATA[<p>Whilst this manual provides controls for specific technologies, not all systems will use all of these technologies.  When a system is developed, the agency will determine the appropriate scope of the system and which controls within this manual are applicable.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="1.1.42." ><![CDATA[<p>If a control within this manual is outside the scope of the system then non-compliance processes <em>do not apply</em>.  However, if a control is within the scope of the system yet the agency chooses <em>not to implement</em> the control, then they are required to follow the non-compliance procedures as outlined below in order to provide appropriate governance and assurance.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="1.1.43." ><![CDATA[<p>The procedures and controls described in the NZISM are designed, not only to counter or prevent known common attacks, but also to protect from emerging threats.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Identification and Selection of controls"><paragraph title="1.1.44." ><![CDATA[<p>In all cases controls have been selected as the most effective means of mitigating identified risks and threats.  Each control has been carefully researched and risk assessed against a wide range of factors, including useability, threat levels, likelihood, rapid technology changes, sustainability, effectiveness and cost.  </p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Controls with a “MUST” or “MUST NOT” requirement"><paragraph title="1.1.45." ><![CDATA[<p>A control with a “MUST” or “MUST NOT” requirement indicates that use, or non-use, of the control is essential in order to effectively manage the identified risk, unless the control is demonstrably not relevant to the respective system.  These controls are baseline controls, sometimes described as systems hygiene controls.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="1.1.46." ><![CDATA[<p>The rationale for non-use of baseline controls MUST be clearly demonstrated to the Accreditation Authority as part of the certification process, before approval for exceptions is granted.  MUST and MUST NOT controls take precedence over SHOULD and SHOULD NOT controls.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Controls with a “SHOULD” or “SHOULD NOT” requirement"><paragraph title="1.1.47." ><![CDATA[<p>A control with a “SHOULD” or “SHOULD NOT” requirement indicates that use, or non-use, of the control is considered good and recommended practice. Valid reasons for not implementing a control could exist, including:</p><ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li>A control is not relevant in the agency;</li>
<li>A system or ICT capability does not exist in the agency; or </li>
<li>A process or control(s) of equal strength has been substituted.</li>
</ol>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="1.1.48." ><![CDATA[<p>While some cases may require a simple record of fact, agencies must recognise that non-use of any control, without due consideration, may increase residual risk for the agency. This residual risk needs to be agreed and acknowledged by the Accreditation Authority. In particular an agency should pose the following questions:</p><ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li>Is the agency willing to accept additional risk?</li>
<li>Have any implications for All-of-Government systems been considered?</li>
<li>If, so, what is the justification?</li>
</ol>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="1.1.49." ><![CDATA[<p>A formal auditable record of this consideration and decision is required as part of the IA governance and assurance processes within an agency.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Non-compliance"><paragraph title="1.1.50." ><![CDATA[<p>Non-compliance is a risk to the agency and may also pose risks to other agencies and organisations.  Good governance requires these risks are clearly articulated, measures are implemented to manage and reduce the identified risks to acceptable levels, that the Accreditation Authority is fully briefed, acknowledges any residual and additional risk and approves the measures to reduce risk. </p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="1.1.51." ><![CDATA[<p>In some circumstances, full compliance with this manual may not be possible, for example some legacy systems may not support the configuration of particular controls.  In such circumstances, a risk assessment should clearly identify <em>compensating</em> controls to reduce risks to an acceptable level.  Acceptance of risk or residual risk, without due consideration is NOT adequate or acceptable.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="1.1.52." ><![CDATA[<p>It is recognised that agencies may not be able to immediately implement all controls described in the manual due to resource, budgetary, capability or other constraints.  Good practice risk management processes will acknowledge this and prepare a timeline and process by which the agency can implement all appropriate controls described in this manual.  </p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="1.1.53." ><![CDATA[<p>Simply acknowledging risks and not providing the means to implement controls <em>does not</em> represent effective risk management.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="1.1.54." ><![CDATA[<p>Where multiple controls are not relevant or an agency chooses not to implement multiple controls within this manual the system owner may choose to logically group and consolidate controls when following the processes for non-compliance.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Rationale Statements"><paragraph title="1.1.55." ><![CDATA[<p>A short rationale is provided with each group of controls.  It is intended that this rationale is read in conjunction with the relevant controls in order to provide context and guidance.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
</subsection>
<subsection title="Risk management"> <block title="Risk Management Standards"><paragraph title="1.1.56." ><![CDATA[<p>For security risk management to be of true value to an agency it MUST relate to the specific circumstances of an agency and its systems, as well as being based on an industry recognised approach or risk management guidelines. For example, guidelines and standards produced by <a title="Standards NZ" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://standards.govt.nz/" target="_blank">Standards New Zealand</a> and the <a title="International Organization for Standardization" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.iso.org/home.html" target="_blank">International Organization for Standardization (ISO).</a></p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="1.1.57." ><![CDATA[<p>The <a title="International Organization for Standardization" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.iso.org/home.html" target="_blank">International Organization for Standardization</a> has published an international risk management standard, including principles and guidelines on implementation, outlined in <a title="ISO 31000:2018 - Risk Management Guidelines" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.iso.org/standard/65694.html" target="_blank">ISO 31000:2018 - Risk Management - Guidelines</a>. &nbsp;Refer to the tables below for additional reference materials.</p>]]></paragraph>

<block title="The NZISM and Risk Management "><paragraph title="1.1.58." ><![CDATA[<p>The NZISM encapsulates good and recommended best-practice in managing technology risks and mitigating or minimising threat to New Zealand government information systems.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="1.1.59." ><![CDATA[<p>Because there is a broad range of systems across government and the age and technological sophistication of these systems varies widely, there is no single governance, assurance, risk or controls model that will accommodate all agencies information and technology security needs. </p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="1.1.60." ><![CDATA[<p>The NZISM contains guidance on governance and assurance processes and technological controls based on comprehensive risk and threat assessments, research and environmental monitoring.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="1.1.61." ><![CDATA[<p>The NZISM encourages agencies to take a similar risk-based approach to information security.  This approach enables the flexibility to allow agencies to conduct their business and maintain resilience in the face of a changing threat environment, while recognising the essential requirements and guidance provided by the NZISM.</p>]]></paragraph>

<paragraph title="1.1.64.R.02." ><![CDATA[<p>Controls within this manual with a “SHOULD” and “SHOULD NOT” requirement may be risk managed by agencies. As the individual control security risk for non-compliance is not as high as those controls with a ‘MUST’ or ‘MUST NOT’ requirement, the Accreditation Authority can consider the justification for the acceptance of risks, consider any mitigations then acknowledge and accept any residual risks.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="1.1.64.R.03." ><![CDATA[<p>Deviations from the procedures and controls in the NZISM may represent risks in themselves. It is important that governance and assurance is supported by evidence, especially where deviations from the procedures and controls in the NZISM are accepted.  In this case a formal approval or signoff by the Accreditation Authority is essential. Ultimately, the Agency Head remains accountable for the ICT risks and information security of their agency.</p>]]></paragraph>

<block title="Justification for non-compliance"><paragraph title="1.1.65.R.01." ><![CDATA[<p>Without sufficient justification and consideration of security risks by the system owner when seeking a dispensation, the agency head or their authorised delegate will lack the appropriate range of information to the make an informed decision on whether to accept the security risk and grant the dispensation or not.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="1.1.65.C.01." classification="All Classifications" compliance="Must" cid="131"><![CDATA[<p>System owners seeking a dispensation for non-compliance with baseline controls MUST complete an agency risk assessment which documents:</p><ul>

<block title="Consultation on non-compliance"><paragraph title="1.1.66.R.01." ><![CDATA[<p>When an agency stores information on their systems that belongs to a foreign government they have an obligation to inform and seek agreement from that third party when they do not apply all appropriate controls in this manual. These third parties will place reliance on the application of controls from the NZISM. If the agency fails to implement all appropriate controls, the third party will be unaware that their information may have been placed at a heightened risk of compromise. As such, the third party is denied the opportunity to consider their own additional risk mitigation measures for their information in light of the agency’s desire to risk manage controls from this manual.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="1.1.66.R.02." ><![CDATA[<p>Most New Zealand Government agencies will store or processes information on their systems that originates from another New Zealand Government Agency. The use of the <a title="NZ Government Security Classification System" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.protectivesecurity.govt.nz/classification-system/" target="_blank">NZ Government Security Classification System</a>, and implementation of its attendant handling instructions, provides assurance to the originating agency that the information is adequately safeguarded.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="1.1.66.R.03." ><![CDATA[<p>Additional controls, not described or specified in this manual, are welcomed as a means of improving and strengthening security of information systems, provided there are no obvious conflicts or contradictions with the controls in this manual.

This assessment is based on the risk environment at the time the dispensation is sought. As the risk environment will continue to evolve over time it is important that agencies revisit the assessment on an annual basis and update it according to the current risk environment, and if necessary reverse any decisions to grant a dispensation if the security risk is no longer of an acceptable level.</p>]]></paragraph>

<subsection title="Rationale &amp; Controls"> <block title="Outsourcing information technology services and functions"><paragraph title="2.2.5.R.01." ><![CDATA[<p>In the context of this section, outsourcing is defined as contracting an outside entity to provide essential business functions and processes that could be undertaken by the Agency itself.</p><p>Outsourcing may present elevated levels of risk and additional risks. Outsourcing therefore, requires greater consideration, demonstrable governance, and higher levels of assurance before committing to such contracts.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="2.2.5.R.02." ><![CDATA[<p>A distinction is drawn between important business functions and the purchase of services such as power, water, building maintenance, stationery and telecommunications. These services are not usually provided by the agency itself.</p><p>Purchased services, as identified above, do NOT require accreditation or a third party review as defined in the NZISM. However, normal contract due diligence should be exercised before committing to these supply contracts.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="2.2.5.R.03." ><![CDATA[<p>Contractors can be provided with classified information as long as their systems are accredited to an appropriate classification in order to process, store and communicate that information. Contractors and all staff with access to the classified systems must also be cleared to the level of the information being processed. This ensures that when they are provided with classified information that it receives an appropriate level of protection.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="2.2.5.R.04." ><![CDATA[<p>New Zealand, in common with most developed countries, has agreements with other nations on information exchange on a variety of topics, including arms control, border control, biosecurity, policing and national security. The lead agency in each sector will usually be the controlling agency for each agreement. While the detail and nature of these agreements is sometimes classified, the agreements invariably require the protection of any information provided, to the level determined by the originator. Agencies that receive such information will be fully briefed by the relevant controlling agency or authority, before information is provided. It is important to note that there is no single list or source of such agreements.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="2.2.5.C.01." classification="All Classifications" compliance="Must" cid="216"><![CDATA[<p>Agencies engaging industry for the provision of off-site information technology services and functions MUST accredit the systems used by the contractor to at least the same minimum standard as the agency’s systems. This may be achieved through a third party review report utilising the ISAE 3402 Assurance Reports on Controls at a Third Party Service Organisation.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="2.2.5.C.02." classification="All Classifications" compliance="Should Not" cid="217"><![CDATA[<p>Agencies SHOULD NOT engage industry for the provision of off-site information technology services and functions in countries that New Zealand does not have a multilateral or bilateral security agreement with for the protection of classified information of the government of New Zealand. If there is any doubt, the agency’s CISO should be consulted.</p>]]></paragraph>

<block title="Independence of ITSMs from outsourced companies"><paragraph title="2.2.6.R.01." ><![CDATA[<p>If an agency engages an organisation for the provision of information technology services and functions, and where that organisation also provides the services of an Information Technology Security Manager, they need to ensure that there is no actual or perceived conflict of interest (See also <a title="ITSM" href="http://nzism.gcsb.govt.nz/ism-document#Section-12348">Section 3.3 - Information Technology Security Manager</a>).</p>]]></paragraph>

<paragraph title="2.2.6.C.01." classification="All Classifications" compliance="Should" cid="221"><![CDATA[<p>Where an agency has outsourced information technology services and functions, any ITSMs within the agency SHOULD be independent of the company providing the information technology services and functions.</p>]]></paragraph>

<block title="Mandates, Directives and Requirements "><paragraph title="2.3.6." ><![CDATA[<p>In 2012, Cabinet directed government agencies to adopt public cloud services in preference to traditional IT systems. Offshore-hosted office productivity services were excluded <strong>[CAB Min (12) 29/8A]</strong></p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="2.3.7." ><![CDATA[<p>In August 2013, the Government introduced their approach to cloud computing, establishing a ‘cloud first’ policy and an All-of-Government direction to cloud services development and deployment. &nbsp;This is enabled by the Cabinet Minute <strong>[CAB Min (13) 37/6B]</strong>. &nbsp;Under the ‘cloud first’ policy state service agencies are expected to adopt approved cloud services either when faced with new procurements, or a contract extension decision. &nbsp;</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="2.3.8." ><![CDATA[<p>Cabinet also incorporated the cloud risk assessment process into the system-wide ICT assurance framework <strong>[CAB Min (13) 20/13]</strong>.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="2.3.9." ><![CDATA[<p>The New Zealand Government ICT Strategy released in October 2015 requires agencies to outsource their IT functions using common capabilities and public cloud services where this was feasible and practical.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="2.3.10." ><![CDATA[<p>In 2014 The Government Chief Information Officer published Cloud Computing Information Security and Privacy Considerations.  This guidance is designed to assist agencies systematically identify, analyse, and evaluate information security and privacy risks related to individual public cloud services.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="2.3.11." ><![CDATA[<p>In July 2016, new measures were confirmed to accelerate the adoption of public cloud services by New Zealand’s government agencies.  The new measures complement existing policies and risk assessment processes and provide appropriate checks and balances.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Background"><paragraph title="2.3.12." ><![CDATA[<p>The adoption of cloud technologies and services, the hosting of critical data in the cloud and the risk environment requires that agencies exercise caution.  Many cloud users are driven by the need for performance, scalability, resource sharing and cost saving so a comprehensive risk assessment is essential in identifying and managing jurisdictional, sovereignty, governance, assurance, technical and security risks.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="2.3.13." ><![CDATA[<p>Security requirements and drivers in the cloud differ significantly from traditional data centre environments requiring new security models and architectures.  Key factors include:</p><ul>
<li>The dynamic nature of the cloud and its related infrastructure;</li>
<li>No customer ownership or control of infrastructure;</li>
<li>Limited visibility of architectures and transparency of operations; </li>
<li>Shared (multi-tenanted) physical and virtual environments; and</li>
<li>May require re-architecting of agency system to optimise use of cloud services.</li>
</ul>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="2.3.14." ><![CDATA[<p>While there is potential for significant benefit, flexibility and cost saving, any use of cloud services carries risk.  All cloud computing decisions should be made on a case-by-case basis after a proper risk assessment, the agency technology architecture is developed and security is properly considered and incorporated.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="2.3.15." ><![CDATA[<p>There is also likely to be a significant mismatch in service-level agreements (SLAs) between existing systems and outsourcing arrangements and those of cloud-based services.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="2.3.16." ><![CDATA[<p>It is important to note that although agencies can outsource operational <strong>responsibilities</strong> to a service provider for implementing, managing and maintaining security controls, they cannot outsource their <strong>accountability</strong> for ensuring their data is appropriately protected, including any system or service decommissioning or termination.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="2.3.17." ><![CDATA[<p>The Government Chief Digital Officer (GCDO) has developed a risk and assurance framework for cloud computing, which agencies are required to follow when they are considering using cloud services. </p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Information Security and Zero Trust"><paragraph title="2.3.18." ><![CDATA[<p>Information security relates to the protection of information regardless of its form (electronic or physical).&nbsp; Within government, information security has traditionally been construed using the concepts of confidentiality, availability and integrity of information.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="2.3.19." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS2C3">Relating these concepts to people who access, manage and use that information requires the use of methods to provide:</p><ul>
<li>Authentication;</li>
<li>Authorisation; and</li>
<li>Non-repudiation.</li>
</ul>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="2.3.20." ><![CDATA[<p>With the growth of the internet and cloud services, the proliferation of data and the growth in malicious and cyber-criminal activities, older methods of enabling information security are “fragile”, can be fragmented, and are in some cases, ineffective.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="2.3.21." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS2C3">Zero Trust is a security concept based around the idea that systems and users should not be given access to any information without verification, even when they are connected to internal networks.  Zero Trust looks to acknowledge that the previous concept and approach of using perimeter defences and providing free access within the secure perimeter is no longer practical or appropriate for securing information assets. As such, it should be replaced with robust authentication and verification steps being continuously performed.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="2.3.22." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS2C3">The concept of Zero Trust provides a more complete means of providing information security in an internet and cloud environment.  Understanding, planning for and preparing to adopt cloud services is an ideal time to incorporate Zero Trust concepts and principles into an agency’s information security policies, operations and information handling, processing storage and disposal.</p>]]></paragraph>

</block>
<block title="Background"><paragraph title="2.4.3." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS2C4">There has been a substantial amount of research on quantum computers – machines that exploit quantum mechanical phenomena to solve mathematical problems that are difficult or intractable for conventional computers. The pace of this research is accelerating.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="2.4.4." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS2C4">The development of quantum computing is a rapidly advancing area with multiple innovations being announced regularly, often eclipsing previous forecasts.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="2.4.5." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS2C4">Quantum computers are not expected to fully replace classical computers as quantum effects are currently useful only on particular tasks. However quantum computers will be able to rapidly solve highly complex problems, well beyond the capabilities of today’s supercomputers.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="2.4.6." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS2C4">A prominent area of quantum computing applicability is in the field of cryptanalysis, and it is expected that they will be able to compromise or render ineffective many of the public-key cryptosystems currently in use.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="2.4.7." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS2C4">It is important that agencies are aware of the potential impact developments in quantum computing are likely to have on critical security controls such as encryption.  It is also important that they are preparing to act to minimise the disruptions that could be caused during migrations to post-quantum cryptography (cryptographic systems that remain secure after the widespread availability of quantum computing).</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="2.4.8." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS2C4">Currently there are no post-quantum cryptographic systems approved for use in the NZISM, however there are actions that agencies can undertake to prepare for the time when such systems are approved.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Post-Quantum Cryptographic Standards"><paragraph title="2.4.9." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS2C4">International organisations are evaluating potential candidates for standardisation in post-quantum cryptography.  GCSB will review applicable standards and consider them for incorporation into the NZISM when they are published.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="2.4.10." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS2C4">When standards for quantum-resistant public key cryptography become available, GCSB may deprecate or withdraw support for existing classical cryptographic standards. Agencies should therefore be prepared to transition away from these algorithms possibly in the next 2-3 years, even though the standards to migrate to are still to be developed.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="2.4.11." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS2C4">Until new quantum-resistant algorithms are standardised, agencies should maintain or strengthen their existing cryptographic position using the algorithms, protocols and key lengths specified in <a title="Chapter 17 - Cryptography" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://nzism.gcsb.govt.nz/ism-document#Chapter-15745" target="_blank">Chapter 17 - Cryptography</a>.</p>]]></paragraph>

<chapter title="4. System Certification and Accreditation"><section title="4.1. The Certification and Accreditation Process"><subsection title="Objective"><paragraph title="4.1.1." ><![CDATA[<p>Executives and Security Practitioners understand and enforce the use of the Certification and Accreditation (C&amp;A) process and its role in information security governance and assurance.</p>]]></paragraph>
 </subsection>
<subsection title="Context"> <block title="Scope"><paragraph title="4.1.2." ><![CDATA[<p>This section provides a short, high-level description of the C&amp;A process.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="4.1.3." ><![CDATA[<p>This section must be read in conjunction with the Roles and Responsibilities described in <a title="Roles and responsibilities" href="http://nzism.gcsb.govt.nz/ism-document#Chapter-12255">Chapter 3</a>. Subsequent sections of this chapter describe elements of the C&amp;A process in more detail.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="The Process"><paragraph title="4.1.4." ><![CDATA[<p>Certification and Accreditation is a fundamental governance and assurance process, designed to provide the Board, Chief Executive and senior executives confidence that information and its associated technology are well-managed, that risks are properly identified and mitigated and that governance responsibilities can demonstrably be met. It is essential for credible and effective information assurance governance.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="4.1.5." ><![CDATA[<p>C&amp;A has two important stages where certification must be completed before accreditation can take place. It is based on an assessment of risk, the application of controls described in the NZISM and determination of any residual risk.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="4.1.6." ><![CDATA[<p>Certification and Accreditation are separate and distinct elements, demonstrate segregation of duties and assist in managing any potential conflicts of interest. These are important attributes in good governance systems.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="4.1.7." ><![CDATA[<p>The acceptance of residual risk lies with the Chief Executive of each agency, or lead agency where sector, multi-agency or All-of-Government (AoG) systems are implemented.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="4.1.8." ><![CDATA[<p>An exception applies where High Assurance Cryptographic Equipment (HACE) is required or caveated or compartmented information is processed, stored or communicated. In this case the Director-General, GCSB is the Accreditation Authority.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="4.1.9." ><![CDATA[<p>The complete C&amp;A process has several elements and stages, illustrated in the Block Diagram at the end of this section.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Key Participants"><paragraph title="4.1.10." ><![CDATA[<p>There are four groups of participants:</p><ul>
<li><strong>System Owners</strong>, responsible for the design, development, system documentation and system maintenance, including any requests for recertification or reaccreditation.</li>
<li>The <strong>Certification Authority</strong>, responsible for the review of information and documentation provided by the system owner to ensure the ICT system complies with minimum standards and the agreed design.</li>
<li>The <strong>Assessor</strong> or Auditor, who will conduct inspections, audits and review as instructed by the Certification Authority.</li>
<li>The <strong>Accreditation Authority</strong> will consider the recommendation of the Certification Authority. If the level of residual risk is acceptable, the Accreditation Authority will issue the system accreditation (the formal authority to operate a system).</li>
</ul>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Certification"><paragraph title="4.1.11." ><![CDATA[<p>Certification is the assertion that an ICT system including any related or support services such as Telecommunications or cloud comply with the minimum standards and controls described in the NZISM, any relevant legislation and regulation and other relevant standards. It is based on a comprehensive evaluation or systems audit. This process is described in <a title="Conducting certifications" href="http://nzism.gcsb.govt.nz/ism-document#Section-12507">Section 4.2 – Conducting Certifications</a>.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="4.1.12." ><![CDATA[<p>Certification is evidence that due consideration has been paid to risk, security, functionality, business requirements and is a fundamental part of information systems governance and assurance.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Certification Authorities"><paragraph title="4.1.13." ><![CDATA[<p>For all agency information systems the certification authority is the CISO unless otherwise delegated by the Agency Head.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="4.1.14." ><![CDATA[<p>For external organisations or service providers supporting agencies, the certification authority is the CISO of the agency.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="4.1.15." ><![CDATA[<p>For multi-national, multi-agency, and AoG systems the certification authority is determined by a formal agreement between the parties involved. Within NZ this is usually the lead agency.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Accreditation"><paragraph title="4.1.16." ><![CDATA[<p>Accreditation is the formal authority to operate a system, evidence that governance requirements have been addressed and that the Chief Executive has fulfilled the requirement to manage risk on behalf of the organisation and stakeholders. This element of the C&amp;A process is described in <a title="Accreditation framework" href="http://nzism.gcsb.govt.nz/ism-document#Section-12591">Section 4.4 – Accreditation Framework</a>.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="4.1.17." ><![CDATA[<p>Accreditation ensures that either sufficient security measures have been put in place to protect information that is processed, stored or communicated by the system or that deficiencies in such measures have been identified, assessed and acknowledged, including the acceptance of any residual risk.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Accreditation Authority"><paragraph title="4.1.18." ><![CDATA[<p>For agencies the Accreditation Authority is the agency head or their formally authorised delegate.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="4.1.19." ><![CDATA[<p>For multi-national, multi-agency systems or AoG systems, the Accreditation Authority is determined by a formal agreement between the parties involved.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="4.1.20." ><![CDATA[<p>In all cases the Accreditation Authority will be at least a senior executive who has an appropriate level of understanding of the security risks they are accepting on behalf of the agency.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="4.1.21." ><![CDATA[<p>Depending on the circumstances and practices of an agency, the agency head could choose to delegate their authority to multiple senior executives who have the authority to accept security risks for the specific business functions within the agency.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Conflicts of Interest"><paragraph title="4.1.22." ><![CDATA[<p>A conflict of interest is a situation in which a person has duties or responsibilities to more than one person, organisation or elements of a process, but is placed in a position where they cannot do justice to all. This includes, for example, when an individual's vested interests or concerns are inconsistent with organisational outcomes, or when an official has conflicting responsibilities. In the context of the C&amp;A process, a conflict of interest can occur when an individual has multiple roles, such as being both the system owner and the Accreditation Authority.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="4.1.23." ><![CDATA[<p>A conflict of interest has the potential to undermine impartiality and integrity of a process and the people involved in a process. It will also undermine the integrity of governance and information assurance derived from the C&amp;A process.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="4.1.24." ><![CDATA[<p>Conflicts of interest are normally managed though segregation of duties, the division of <strong>roles</strong> and <strong>responsibilities</strong> in order to reduce the ability or opportunity for an individual to compromise a critical process. Segregation of duties also reduces errors of interpretation or judgement and better manages risk.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="4.1.25." ><![CDATA[<p>It is important to note that in the C&amp;A process in the NZISM, the Certification Authority, System Owner and Accreditation Authority are <em>independent</em> of each other. In smaller agencies, the Assessor may also be the Certification Authority. Ideally this role will also be segregated.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Penetration Testing"><paragraph title="4.1.26." ><![CDATA[<p>Penetration tests are an effective method of identifying vulnerabilities in a system or network, and testing existing security measures and the implementation of controls. Penetration testing is also very useful in validating the effectiveness of the defensive mechanisms. This testing provides an increased level of assurance when system certification and accreditation is undertaken. It also demonstrates prudent risk management.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="4.1.27." ><![CDATA[<p>A penetration test usually involves the use of intrusive methods or attacks conducted by trusted individuals, methods similar to those used by intruders or hackers. Care must be taken not to adversely affect normal operations while these tests are conducted.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="4.1.28." ><![CDATA[<p>Organisations may conduct their own tests and regular simple tests are effective in maintaining the organisation’s security posture. Because of the level of expertise required to effectively conduct more complex testing, comprehensive penetration tests are often outsourced to specialist organisations.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="4.1.29." ><![CDATA[<p>Penetration tests can range from simple scans of IP addresses in order to identify devices or systems offering services with known vulnerabilities, to exploiting known vulnerabilities that exist in an unpatched operating system, applications or other software. The results of these tests or attacks are recorded, analysed, documented and presented to the owner of the system. Any deficiencies should then be addressed.</p>]]></paragraph>

<block title="Audit evidence sufficiency"><paragraph title="4.3.13." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS4C3">The Sufficiency is the measure of the quality (not the quantity) of audit evidence.  It is important, however, that a balance is struck between the extent of the audit, the nature of the system under review, agency risk and the cost, effort and benefit of the audit.  Sufficient evidence should be obtained to allow the auditor to be able to draw reasonable conclusions on which to base the audit opinion.  For evidence to be deemed sufficient, the following aspects should be considered:</p><ul>
<li>Materiality.  Materiality is the threshold where any distorted, missing and incorrect information is likely to have an impact on the risk and security of a system.  Where it becomes clear that there are material deficiencies in the evidence presented more substantive tests may be required or the audit suspended until corrective action has been taken by the agency.</li>
<li>Risk assessment: It is almost impossible to validate every risk identification and selection of risk treatments.  For larger systems a more practical approach may be to validate the identification and treatment of major risks and use sampling techniques for the balance.</li>
<li>Economy: Before gathering or requesting additional audit evidence, it is important to consider whether or not it is feasible or cost-effective to generate this evidence against the benefits, assessed value and time required.</li>

<paragraph title="4.4.12.R.02." ><![CDATA[<p>Accreditations should be commenced at least six months before due date to allow sufficient time for the certification and accreditations processes to be completed. Once three years has elapsed between accreditations, the authority to operate the system (the accreditation) will lapse and the agency will need to either reaccredit the system or request a dispensation to operate without accreditation.

<section title="5.8. Independent Assurance Reports"><subsection title="Objective"><paragraph title="5.8.1." ><![CDATA[<p>To provide assurance to System Owners, Certifiers, Practitioners and Accreditors and to assist system designers, enterprise and security architects where assurance reviews cannot be directly undertaken on service providers.</p>]]></paragraph>
 </subsection>
<subsection title="Context "> <block title="Scope"><paragraph title="5.8.2." ><![CDATA[<p>Independent assurance reports are also variously referred to as third party assurance reporting, third party reviews, attestation reports and SAS 70 reports. It is important to note that SAS 70 has been superseded by the ISAE 3402 and SSAE 16 standards encompassing Type I and 2 and SOC 1, 2 and 3 reports. For reviews conducted in New Zealand the ISAE (NZ) 3402 or ISAE (NZ) 3000 standards are used. These various standards and report types are discussed later in this section. Agencies are likely to encounter a variety of report types, depending on the country of residence or country of jurisdiction of the service provider, or the geographic location of the data centre.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Purpose"><paragraph title="5.8.3." ><![CDATA[<p>Many organisations are outsourcing key components of their business such as telecommunications, data storage and cloud based services. Managing third-party relationships is particularly challenging with services provided from outside New Zealand. The global nature of these services and the global nature of associated risks must be recognised by organisations. As outsourced services are becoming more integrated with organisation’s operations, they will have a larger impact on organisation’s governance, assurance and control frameworks. It is important to note that risk ownership and accountability remains with agencies and respective risk owners, even when responsibility for specific functions have been outsourced.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="5.8.4." ><![CDATA[<p>Independent assurance reports provide customers and other interested parties with information on policies, procedures and controls related to the service provider’s internal frameworks, control objectives and controls in cases where physical inspections and reviews by customers are impractical or not feasible. Service providers may also use the findings of such reports for their own purposes. These reports are used to understand the adequacy and effectiveness of the service provider’s frameworks, control objectives, controls and implementation of controls. They allow:</p><ul>
<li>Business owners to identify and understand the risks associated with the service delivery;</li>
<li>System owners to more fully assess system risks;</li>
<li>System designers and security architects to make informed judgements on system structures, controls, defensive measures, and enterprise integration; and</li>
<li>Regulators, certifiers and accreditors to obtain assurance over the service providers internal control structures and assess the suitability of system structures, controls and defensive measures.</li>
</ul>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="5.8.5." ><![CDATA[<p>An independent assurance review or third-party audit is invariably undertaken by independent auditors who are not employees of the service provider or their customers. There are two common types of independent third-party reviews: attestation reviews and direct non-attestation reviews.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="5.8.6." ><![CDATA[<p>Attestation reviews, such as an ISAE 3402 review (see below), are generally conducted by accounting or consulting organisations and are based upon recognised attestation standards issued by professional bodies such as the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) or the New Zealand External Reporting Board (XRB).</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="5.8.7." ><![CDATA[<p>Direct or non-attestation reviews include those performed by IT consultants or others and may not follow standards referred to previously. They may be based upon other external standards or industry developed criteria such as ISO 2700x, ISACA’s COBIT, the IIA, NIST, or the Cloud Security Alliance (CSA).</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Assurance"><paragraph title="5.8.8." ><![CDATA[<p>Assurance is derived from an assessment of:</p><ul>
<li>A description of the service provider’s business and control environment;</li>
<li>Terms and conditions of the service contract or other legally binding agreement;</li>
<li>Assertions supplied by the service provider (self-assessments);</li>
<li>An independent validation of service provider assertions;</li>
<li>Independent testing of controls implementation and effectiveness;</li>
<li>Assurance in the service design and security architecture; and</li>
<li>Assurance in the service components.</li>
</ul>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="5.8.9." ><![CDATA[<p>In general terms, the more ICT services that are outsourced in an agency, the less direct control and visibility the CE and management have over enterprise operations. Therefore, there is an increased reliance on assurance reporting from suppliers.  Unless this is recognised in service contracts or legal agreements, agencies may find they are unable to obtain sufficient levels of assurance over the business services and enterprise operations.</p>]]></paragraph>

<subsection title="Assurance Standards and schemes"> <block title="ISAE (NZ) 3000"><paragraph title="5.8.10." ><![CDATA[<p>ISAE (NZ) 3000 (Revised) is issued by the External Reporting Board (XRB) of the New Zealand Audit and Assurance Standards Board and is the umbrella standard for other (non-financial) assurance engagements conducted in New Zealand. The standard covers a wide variety of engagements, ranging from assurance on statements about the effectiveness of internal control, for example, to assurance on sustainability reports and possible future engagements addressing integrated reporting. It is a principle-based standard that underpins current and future subject-specific ISAEs (NZ).</p>]]></paragraph>

<paragraph title="5.8.13." ><![CDATA[<p>Based on its predecessor standard SAS 70 (1992), ISAE 3402 was developed to provide an international assurance standard for allowing public accountants to issue a report for use by user organisations and their auditors (user auditors) on the controls at a service organisation that are likely to impact or be a part of the user organisation’s system of internal control over financial reporting.</p>]]></paragraph>

<block title="ISAE 3402 Report Types"><paragraph title="5.8.15." ><![CDATA[<p>The ISAE 3402 provides for a report on controls at a point in time (Type 1 Report) or covering a specified period of time, usually between six and twelve months (Type 2 Report).</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="5.8.16." ><![CDATA[<p>A Type 1 report is of limited use as it cannot cover the operating effectiveness of controls and is generally used for new operations where there is no evidence or documented history.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="5.8.17." ><![CDATA[<p>A Type 2 report not only includes the service organisation's description of controls, but also includes detailed testing of the service organisation's controls over a minimum six month period.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="5.8.18." ><![CDATA[<p>It is important to note that the descriptions Type 1 and Type 2 represent an audit approach and should not be confused with SOC 1, 2 and 3 reports under SSAE 16 (see below).</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="ISAE 3402 Report Uses and Limitations"><paragraph title="5.8.19." ><![CDATA[<p>This standard is used to obtain reasonable assurance about whether:</p><ul>
<li>The service organisation’s description of its system fairly presents the system as designed and implemented throughout a specified period or a specific date;</li>
<li>The controls related to the control objectives stated in the service organisation’s description of its system were suitably designed throughout the specified period or at the specified date;</li>
<li>Where included in the scope of the engagement, the controls were implemented and operated effectively to provide reasonable assurance that the control objectives stated in the service organisation’s description of its system were achieved throughout the specified period.</li>
</ul>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="5.8.20." ><![CDATA[<p>This ISAE applies only when the service organisation is responsible for, or otherwise able to make an assertion about, the suitable design of controls. It does not cover situations where:</p><ul>
<li>reporting only whether controls at a service organisation operated as described; or</li>
<li>reporting on controls at a service organisation other than those related to a service relevant to user entities.</li>
</ul>]]></paragraph>

<paragraph title="5.8.23." ><![CDATA[<p>SSAE 16 is the US equivalent of the international ISAE 3402 and came into effect on<br>15 June 2011. While the SSAE 16 and ISAE 3402 standards have a common purpose and intent, , there are nine very specific requirements in SSAE 16, not covered in ISAE 3402:</p><ul>
<li>Intentional acts by the service providers staff;</li>
<li>Anomalies;</li>
<li>Direct assistance;</li>
<li>Subsequent events;</li>
<li>Statement restricting use of the service auditor’s report;</li>
<li>Disclaimer of Opinion;</li>
<li>Documentation completion;</li>
<li>Engagement acceptance and continuance; and</li>
<li>Elements of the SSAE 16 report that are not required in the ISAE 3402 report.</li>

<paragraph title="5.8.25." ><![CDATA[<p>The SSAE 16 standard specifies Type 1 and 2 audits (as does ISAE 3402).</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="5.8.26." ><![CDATA[<p>A Type 1 is a report on a description of a service organisation’s system and the suitability of the design of controls. A Type 1 report will test the design effectiveness of defined controls by examining a sample of one item per control. This provides a basic level of assurance that the organisation has some controls in place. It does not measure the completeness or effectiveness of these controls and represents a point in time.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="5.8.27." ><![CDATA[<p>A Type2 report is a report on policies and procedures placed in operation and tests of operating effectiveness for a specified period of time. A Type 2 report undertakes the tests in a Type 1 report together with an evaluation of the operating effectiveness of the controls for a period of at least six consecutive calendar months.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="AICPA Service Organisation Control Reporting (SOC Reports)"><paragraph title="5.8.28." ><![CDATA[<p>Service Organization Control (SOC) Reports, often known as SOC 1, SOC 2, and SOC 3 Reports, are derived from a framework published by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) for reporting on controls at service organisations.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="5.8.29." ><![CDATA[<p>In New Zealand, SOC 1 reports follow the ISAE (NZ) 3402 standard and SOC 2 reports are follow the ISAE (NZ) 3000 standard, in conjunction with the NZ Standard for Assurance Engagements SAE 3150, for assurance engagements on controls.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="5.8.30." ><![CDATA[<p>Each of the three SOC reports are designed to meet specific needs and reporting requirements for service organisations themselves, rather than being designed to provide assurance to third parties (customers). It is important to note that these reports follow the US (SSAE 16) and Canadian accounting standards, rather than the international ISAE 3402.</p><p><strong>SOC 1 Report – Report on Controls at a Service Organization Relevant to User Entities’ Internal Control over Financial Reporting.</strong> Reporting on controls relevant to internal control over financial reporting and usually conducted in accordance with Statement on Standards for Attestation Engagements (SSAE) No. 16 and AT 801 – Reporting on Controls at a Service Organization. A SOC 1 report can be based on a Type 1 or a Type 2 audit.</p><p><strong>SOC 2 Report— Report on Controls at a Service Organization Relevant to Security, Availability, Processing Integrity, Confidentiality or Privacy.</strong> SOC 2 Reporting follows the AICPA AT Section 101 (not SSAE 16) and encompasses controls at service organisations on security, availability, processing Integrity, confidentiality and privacy. SOC 2 reports assist in comparing two or more data centres or service providers.</p><p><strong>SOC 3 Report— Trust Services Report for Service Organizations.</strong> As well as reporting on controls relevant to security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality and privacy a SOC 3 report provides the same level of assurance about controls over security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality and/or privacy as a SOC 2 report. The key difference is that a SOC 3 report is intended for general release and does not include the detailed description of the testing performed by the auditor. In place of the detailed description a summary opinion regarding the effectiveness of the controls in place at the data centre or service organisation is provided.</p><p><strong>SOC Reports Summary</strong></p><table class="table-main">

<block title="Management Assertions"><paragraph title="5.8.31." ><![CDATA[<p>See Assertions in Certification and Accreditation (<a title="Assertions in Certification and Accreditation" href="http://nzism.gcsb.govt.nz/ism-document#Block-12423">NZISM 3.4.3 to 3.4.7</a>) for a short discussion on the nature and purpose of assertions.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="5.8.32." ><![CDATA[<p>The SSAE 16 requires a written assertion by management. Also known as a management’s assertion or service organisation assertion it is essentially an assertion made by the service organisation representing and asserting to a number of elements, including:</p><ul>
<li>The description fairly presents the service organisation's system;</li>
<li>That the control objectives were suitably designed (SSAE 16 Type 1) and operating effectively (SSAE 16 Type 2) during the dates and/or periods covered by the report; and</li>
<li>The criteria used for making these assertions, (which are additional statements with supporting matter regarding risk factors relating to control objectives and underlying controls) were in place (Type 1) and were consistently applied (Type 2).</li>
</ul>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="ISO/IEC 27001 Certification"><paragraph title="5.8.33." ><![CDATA[<p>ISO/IEC 27001 is an international standard that provides a framework for Information Security Management Systems. The standard is designed to help organisations of all sizes and types to select suitable and proportionate security controls for information. It provides a structured approach to assist in managing risk by identifying information security vulnerabilities and selecting appropriate controls.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="5.8.34." ><![CDATA[<p>This standard enables independent, external certification bodies to audit the ISMS and certify that the requirements of the standard have been met. Such certification is another means of deriving assurance over the operations of service providers. The requirements for certification are described in the ISO/IEC 27006:2015 standard. Certification is based on two reviews:</p><ul>
<li>Stage 1 audit (also called Documentation review) checking the systems documentation is compliant with ISO 27001;</li>
<li>Stage 2 audit (also called Main audit) checking that all the organisation’s activities are compliant with both ISO 27001 and the systems documentation.</li>
</ul>]]></paragraph>

<subsection title="Other Guidance"> <block title="Cloud Security Alliance’s Security, Trust and Assurance Registry (STAR) Attestation"><paragraph title="5.8.35." ><![CDATA[<p>STAR Certification is a rigorous third party independent assessment of the security of a cloud service provider. It is based on the ISAE 3402 and SSAE 16 standards, supplemented by the criteria in the Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) Cloud Controls Matrix (CCM).</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="5.8.36." ><![CDATA[<p>STAR is a free, publicly accessible registry that documents the security controls provided by various cloud computing service providers. The registry lists three levels of assurance:</p><ol>
<li>Self-assessment;</li>
<li>Third party assessment based attestation or certification; and</li>
<li>Continuous monitoring based certification.</li>
</ol><p><b>Note: </b>Agencies should note that a self-assessment does not necessarily provide substantive assurance.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="5.8.37." ><![CDATA[<p>As at March 2017, the STAR scheme is still to be fully implemented although there are a number of cloud service providers listed in the registry.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="5.8.38." ><![CDATA[<p>Agencies can use this registry to further inform their judgement on the robustness of assurance over cloud service provider’s internal operations and implementation of security controls.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Cloud Security Alliance’s Cloud Controls Matric (CCM)"><paragraph title="5.8.39." ><![CDATA[<p>The CCM covers 16 control domains and provides fundamental security principles to guide cloud service providers and to assist prospective cloud customers in assessing the overall security risk of a cloud service provider.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="5.8.40." ><![CDATA[<p>The CCM references and maps its controls to internationally accepted industry standards, regulations, and control frameworks, such as ISO 27001/2/17/18, PCI: DSS v3, and AICPA 2014 Trust Service Principles and Criteria, Germany’s BIS, Canada’s PIPEDA, ISACA’s COBIT, the US FedRAMP, HIPAA, Jericho Forum, NIST and the NZISM.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Cloud Security Alliance’s Consensus Assessments Initiative Questionnaire (CAIQ)"><paragraph title="5.8.41." ><![CDATA[<p>The CAIQ is an extension to the CCM that provides exemplar control assertion questions that can be asked of service providers in the context of each CCM control, and can be tailored to suit each unique cloud customer’s evidentiary requirements. The Government Chief Digital Officer (GCDO) maintain a mapping of the CAIQ questions to the <em>GCIO Cloud Security and Privacy Considerations</em> question set to further aid agencies in use of the CAIQ as an alternative to equivalent GCDO questions.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="ISACA IT Audit and Assurance Program for Cloud Computing "><paragraph title="5.8.42." ><![CDATA[<p>Based on ISACA’s IT Assurance Framework (ITAF), the Cloud Computing Assurance Program was developed as a comprehensive and good-practice model, aligned with the ISACA COBIT 5 framework. Building on the generic assurance program, the cloud computing guidance identifies a number of cloud specific risk areas encompassing:</p><ul>
<li>Greater dependency on third parties;</li>
<li>Increased complexity of compliance with national and international laws and regulations;</li>
<li>Reliance on the Internet as the primary conduit to the enterprise’s data; and</li>
<li>Risk due to the dynamic nature of cloud computing.</li>
</ul>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="5.8.43." ><![CDATA[<p>The ITAF assurance focus is on:</p><ul>
<li>The governance affecting cloud computing;</li>
<li>The contractual compliance between the service provider and customer;</li>
<li>Privacy and regulation issues concerning cloud computing; and</li>
<li>Cloud computing specific attention points.</li>
</ul>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="5.8.44." ><![CDATA[<p>It is important to note that this cloud computing assurance review is not designed to provide assurance on the design and operational effectiveness of the cloud computing service provider’s internal controls, as this assurance is often provided through ISAE 3604 or similar reviews.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="5.8.45." ><![CDATA[<p>The cloud computing assurance review focusses on the agency’s or organisation’s systems design and operational effectiveness in relation to cloud services. It is also important to note that this is dependent on the effectiveness of the underlying system design and controls and how well these are implemented and managed.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="ASD Certified Cloud Services"><paragraph title="5.8.46." ><![CDATA[<p>The Australian Signals Directorate (ASD) conducts certification of cloud services based in Australia for Australian government use. ASD Certifications are based on the Australian Government Information Security Manual (ISM). It is important to note that there are detail differences between the Australian ISM and the NZISM and these documents have a different legislative and regulatory basis.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="5.8.47." ><![CDATA[<p>The ASD Cloud Computing Security documents describe security risk mitigations associated with cloud computing. Australian Government agencies are also required to perform due diligence reviews of the legal, financial and privacy risks associated with procuring cloud services, aspects which are not covered by the ASD certification.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="NIST 800-53"><paragraph title="5.8.48." ><![CDATA[<p>The NIST Special Publication 800-53 Revision 4 - Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems and Organizations is the US unified information security framework for US federal government agencies. The New Zealand equivalent is the NZISM.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="5.8.49." ><![CDATA[<p>The underlying mandates are in FIPS Publication 200, Minimum Security Requirements for Federal Information and Information Systems and FIPS Publication 199, Standards for Security Categorization of Federal Information and Information Systems. US federal government agencies are required to categorise and analyse their system in terms of FIPS 199 and 200 then apply appropriate controls from NIST 800-53.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="FedRAMP"><paragraph title="5.8.50." ><![CDATA[<p>The US Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) is a government-wide program intended to provide a standardised approach to security assessment, authorisation, and continuous monitoring for cloud products and services. This approach is designed to provide reusable cloud security assessments in order to reduce cost, resource and time. In addition it was intended to minimise cybersecurity risk for Federal Agencies as they move operations to the cloud, provide consistent baseline security policies and streamline the procurement process.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="5.8.51." ><![CDATA[<p>FedRAMP is a collaboration of cybersecurity and cloud experts from the General Services Administration (GSA), National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Department of Defense (DOD), National Security Agency (NSA), Office of Management and Budget (OMB), the Federal Chief Information Officer (CIO) Council and its working groups, as well as private industry.</p><p>The FedRAMP programme is run by the FedRAMP Program Management Office as part of the GSA.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="5.8.52." ><![CDATA[<p>FedRAMP is mandatory for Federal Agency cloud deployments at all risk impact levels.  Private cloud deployments from single agencies and fully implemented within federal facilities are an exception to this mandate.  Quarterly reporting by each agency on their cloud portfolio is required.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="5.8.53." ><![CDATA[<p>FedRAMP authorises cloud systems in a three step process:</p><ol>
<li><strong>Security Assessment:</strong> The security assessment process uses a standardised set of requirements in accordance with FISMA using a baseline set of NIST 800-53 controls with additional controls specific to cloud deployments, in order to grant security authorisations. Cryptographic elements are governed by the FIPS 140-2 standards.<br><br></li>
<li><strong>Leveraging and Authorisation:</strong> Federal agencies view security authorisation packages in the FedRAMP repository and leverage the security authorisation packages to grant a security authorisation at their own agency.<br><br></li>
<li><strong>Ongoing Assessment &amp; Authorisation:</strong> Once an authorisation is granted, ongoing assessment and authorisation activities are required to maintain the security authorisation.</li>
</ol>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="5.8.54." ><![CDATA[<p>Again it is important to note that the FedRAMP assessments are conducted on a different legislative and regulatory basis to assessments conducted in New Zealand. A variety of guidance, controls, templates and other documentation is available online from the GSA (see References - Assurance Guidance )</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="PCI DSS"><paragraph title="5.8.55." ><![CDATA[<p>The Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council was formed by major credit card organisations and is a global open body formed to develop and promote understanding of essential security standards for payment account security. It develops, maintains and promotes the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (PCI DSS). It also provides tools to assist the implementation of the standards such as assessment and scanning qualifications, self-assessment questionnaires, training and education, and product certification programs.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="5.8.56." ><![CDATA[<p>This standard is designed to protect cardholder data (credit and debit cards) held by merchants, banks and other financial organisations. It applies to all organisations that accept, store, process and transmit credit cardholder data.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="5.8.57." ><![CDATA[<p>This standard is narrowly focussed and has specific applicability to New Zealand Government agencies that operate financial transaction services (e.g. AoG Banking services and citizen fee-paying services; such as vehicle registration, passport renewal, etc.). The PCI has published an information supplement on Third-Party Security Assurance (updated March 2016).</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="COSO"><paragraph title="5.8.58." ><![CDATA[<p>The Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) initially developed the COSO Internal Control-Integrated Framework in 1992. A revised framework was published in 2013 which included guidance on “outsourced service providers” and how they impact risk assessment, controls, monitoring, information flows and assurance. The 2013 Framework incorporates how organisations should manage IT innovation in light of globalisation, complex business processes, regulatory demands and security risk assessments. It is frequently used as the basis for SSAE16 assignments and the production of SOC reports.</p>]]></paragraph>

<subsection title="Rationale &amp; Controls"> <block title="Risk Assessment "><paragraph title="5.8.61.R.01." ><![CDATA[<p>The Security Risk Management Plan (<a title="SRMP" href="http://nzism.gcsb.govt.nz/ism-document#Section-12761">SRMP – Section 5.3</a>) encompasses all risks associated with the security of agency systems. The growth in outsourced services, particularly cloud services, has created situations where risk, controls and assurance cannot be directly examined and assessed. In such cases independent assurance reports are an effective means, possibly the only means, of obtaining some assurance on the service provider’s operations.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="5.8.61.R.02." ><![CDATA[<p>No single independent assurance scheme/standard covers the full range of considerations and control requirements of the NZISM. Agencies may find duplication of aspects analysed if multiple schemes are applied. It is also important to note that none of the common mature assurance schemes cover specific government requirements and handling of Official Information; such as the personnel aspects (PERSEC) of user and administration vetting and security clearances, or sovereignty aspects of the information/data. Careful selection and consideration is required when placing reliance on reports available for a particular outsourced or cloud service.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="5.8.61.R.03." ><![CDATA[<p>Reports from different assurance scheme have varying levels of detail as well as risk area coverage. Selection and usage of reports should be considered in the context of the intended service/system business and information value.</p><p>Understanding the business and technical risk context will drive the size and depth of a risk assessment, and the associated assurance process. Though even a lighter-weight risk assurance process will follow the C&amp;A process model, such that the CE or authorised delegate is still formally accountable and responsible.</p><p>Re-use of assessments completed by other agencies is encouraged, noting the business or information value context may differ. To assist agencies and promote efficiency, the Government Chief Digital Officer (GCDO) facilitates the sharing and re-use of existing cloud assessment materials among agencies.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="5.8.61.C.01." classification="All Classifications" compliance="Must" cid="1019"><![CDATA[<p>Agencies MUST conduct a risk assessment in order to determine the type and level of independent assurance required to satisfy certification and accreditation requirements.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="5.8.61.C.02." classification="All Classifications" compliance="Should" cid="1020"><![CDATA[<p>In all cases where assurance on service provider operations cannot be obtained directly, agencies SHOULD obtain independent assurance reports.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="5.8.61.C.03." classification="All Classifications" compliance="Should" cid="1021"><![CDATA[<p>In order to address identified risk areas, agencies SHOULD obtain relevant assurance reports and service provider certifications to inform a risk assessment and Certification activities as well as other aspects of the certification processes such as evidence of controls effectiveness and remediation plans.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Independent Assurance"><paragraph title="5.8.62.R.01." ><![CDATA[<p>Independent assurance can be obtained directly from the service provider through Service Organisation Control (SOC) reports, as well as other internationally recognised assurance frameworks. It will be important to corroborate individual reports by comparison with other reporting mechanisms and independent certifications.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="5.8.62.C.01." classification="All Classifications" compliance="Must" cid="1024"><![CDATA[<p>Agencies MUST incorporate the results of any independent assurance reports into the agency Certification process, to understand the residual risk position and controls required to manage risk appropriately.</p>]]></paragraph>

<section title="5.9. Vulnerability Disclosure Policy (VDP)"><subsection title="Objective"><paragraph title="5.9.1." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS5C9">Agencies implement a Vulnerability Disclosure Policy (VDP) to enable members of the public to report vulnerabilities in the agency’s public-facing systems and applications and receive feedback on such reports.</p>]]></paragraph>
 </subsection>
<subsection title="Context"> <block title="Scope"><paragraph title="5.9.2." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS5C9">This section provides information on vulnerability disclosure for all externally-facing agency systems, including public-facing systems.&nbsp; Vulnerability disclosure relating to internal systems is covered in <a title="Product security" href="http://nzism.gcsb.govt.nz/ism-document#Chapter-14397">Chapter 12 – Product Security</a>.&nbsp;</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="5.9.3." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS5C9">When selecting which systems, applications and data are within scope of a VDP, agencies may consider:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li>The sensitivity of information on the agency’s systems, including financial data, medical information, proprietary information, customer data or other personal information.</li>
<li>Security safeguards that are already in place on the system, such as encryption of data at rest.</li>
<li>The agency’s ability to segment its network or otherwise segregate sensitive information stored on its systems.</li>
<li>Regulatory, contractual, privacy or other restrictions placed on disclosure of protected classes of information (such as within the New Zealand Classification System).</li>
</ol>]]></paragraph>

<block title="Agencies must expect vulnerabilities"><paragraph title="5.9.5." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS5C9">Invariably all software, operating systems and applications have the potential to house exploitable vulnerabilities.  Many vulnerabilities are identified by users and other third parties. Some vulnerabilities may be undiscovered or inherent in the application or software.  Others may be introduced during upgrades, patches, configuration or other changes. </p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="5.9.6." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS5C9">It is essential that agencies establish a policy and processes to identify and remediate such vulnerabilities.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Agencies must establish a vulnerability reporting mechanism"><paragraph title="5.9.7." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS5C9">Published VDPs demonstrate that an agency has a mature and constructive approach when they receive a vulnerability report and also demonstrates openness and transparency in the management of agency systems.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="5.9.8." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS5C9">Agencies should establish a process to allow any user (whether a member of the public, business partners, other agencies or agency staff), to report potential vulnerabilities.&nbsp; Any such reporting is on a “no blame” basis, without fear of repercussion or penalty, provided the agency’s disclosure policy is followed and no illegal activity is undertaken.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="5.9.9." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS5C9">The VDP must clearly state the conditions under which reports are received.  In general terms this also includes a “no bug bounty” clause as well as limits on web site, system or application probing.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="5.9.10." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS5C9">An agency’s VDP will necessarily reflect that they may not control or own all of the software they use or the maintenance and development of underlying software (such as compilers, programming or scripting languages and so on).  The VDP should clearly state that while the agency can receive reports about software, systems or services run on their behalf by third parties, providers or vendors, they may have to work with the reporting party to report the vulnerability to the relevant vendor.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="5.9.11." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS5C9">Where specific legislation applies, for example a reported vulnerability may breach the Privacy Act, agencies must adhere to the legislation.  This may change how reports are managed and action communicated to the finder or reporter.  This does not change the requirement to maintain communication with the reporter/finder.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Agencies are expected to find and remediate vulnerabilities"><paragraph title="5.9.12." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS5C9">The Protective Security Requirements places clear expectations on agencies to maintain awareness of vulnerabilities (see <a title="PSR Mandatory requirements" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://protectivesecurity.govt.nz/information-security/mandatory-requirements-2/" target="_blank">mandatory requirement INFOSEC4</a>).</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="5.9.13." ><![CDATA[<p>The NZISM <a title="Product patching and updating" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://nzism.gcsb.govt.nz/ism-document#Section-14530" target="_blank">section 12.4 - Patching &amp; updating</a>&nbsp;sets out expectations and controls to ensure security patches are applied in a timely manner.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="5.9.14." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS5C9">The disclosure period commonly used by many vendors, manufacturers and government agencies is 90 days.  Vulnerabilities will be either patched, mitigated or managed within this period.  In some cases earlier notification is provided to allow users to take mitigating actions until a patch or other solution is available.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="5.9.15." ><![CDATA[<p>VDPs are expected to include a timeframe within which patches will be applied or remedial action taken when a vulnerability is reported to the agency.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Agencies to create a vulnerability reporting point"><paragraph title="5.9.16." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS5C9">When security risks in agency services are discovered and reported to the agency, it is vital that a robust communication channel is available to receive the report.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="5.9.17." ><![CDATA[<p>This is commonly described as a “security.txt”.  A draft standard has been published (see References below) to help agencies (and other organisations) outline a process for security researchers to securely report security vulnerabilities.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Vulnerability disclosure policies are a normal part of learning about and patching vulnerabilities"><paragraph title="5.9.18." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS5C9">Vulnerability disclosure (sometimes also referred to as responsible disclosure or coordinated vulnerability disclosure) is now an internationally accepted practice for technology organisations.  The practice of vulnerability disclosure in modern computing dates to the late 1980s.  There are related examples (non-computing) which appeared in the mid-1800s when locksmiths exchanged vulnerability information.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Bug Bounties"><paragraph title="5.9.19." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS5C9">“Bug bounties” are a monetary reward to security researchers for the discovery and reporting of software and other information system vulnerabilities to the agency.  Bug Bounties are separate to VDPs and should only be covered if the agency has a bug bounty programme in place.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Vulnerability disclosure policy (VDP) Content"><paragraph title="5.9.20." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS5C9">A VDP will typically include:</p><ul>
<li>A scoping statement setting out which systems the policy applies to (e.g. the agency’s website and other public-facing systems);</li>
<li>Details of how finders can contact the agency’s security team (including any public keys for encrypting reports);</li>
<li>Permitted activities;</li>
<li>Acknowledgement of reports and a response time (typically 60 or 90 days) for corrections, adjustments, or other “fixes”;</li>
<li>Reporters/finders agreeing to not share information about the vulnerability until the end of the disclosure period, to let the organisation fix the issues before it becomes public;</li>
<li>Illegal activities are not permitted (specifying any relevant legislation, such as the Crimes Act, the Privacy Act etc.); and</li>
<li>Either a statement that bug bounties will not be paid for any discoveries, or information about the agency’s bug bounty programme.</li>

<paragraph title="7.2.6." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS7C2">The information security threat and intelligence landscape continues to evolve, partly  driven by more advanced, capable, well-resourced and motivated adversaries, as well as the need to improve management and governance of information systems.  To assist in managing these requirements, a standardised form of information exchange is essential.</p>]]></paragraph>

</block>
<block title="Historical Notes"><paragraph title="7.2.8." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS7C2">While the requirement for incident reporting has been in place for many years, the reporting mechanism has changed over time:</p><ul>
<li>Incident categories, incident types and resolution types were previously defined in the Incident Object Description Exchange Format (IODEF) standard.  IODEF was an e-GIF standard.</li>
<li>IODEF was superseded by a group of protocols designed to automate and structure operational cybersecurity information sharing techniques on a global basis.  International in scope and free for public use, TAXII, STIX and CybOX are community-driven technical specifications designed to enable automated information sharing.</li>
<li>These protocols continued to evolve with CybOX absorbed into the protocol suite and no longer separately identified.</li>
<li>An alternative to TAXII and STIX is VERIS ( The vocabulary for Event Recording and Incident Sharing), a set of metrics designed to provide a common language for describing security incidents in a structured and repeatable manner.</li>
<li>Previously New Zealand’s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) had adopted this suite of protocols as the basis for incident reports to the NCSC and for reports issued by the NCSC.</li>
<li>It was found, however, that agencies were not always able to utilise these protocols and <strong>the requirement for reporting using these protocols has been withdrawn by the NCSC</strong>.</li>
</ul>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Background"><paragraph title="7.2.9." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS7C2">Security Incidents are frequently also termed “a hack”, “a breach”, “a compromise” and “a cyber attack”.  The more colloquial terms may not correctly describe the nature and effect of the incident and should be used with care, if used at all.  It is important to note that security incidents include physical incidents (such as lost documents) as well as “cyber” incidents.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="7.2.10." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS7C2">The detection, recording, management and response to an incident depends primarily on effective prevention and detection mechanisms and a robust response plan.  Effective detection and response mechanisms also provide an important record of events and assist in preventing repeat events, improving defences and streamlining response measures.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="7.2.11." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS7C2">A key part of the detection and response is incident reporting, including internal security system reports as well as any essential external reporting.  It is essential that response is timely and methodical in order to minimise the effects of the incident.  In all cases it is vital that steps are taken to quickly contain the incident, minimise damage and implement measures to prevent or contain any reoccurrence.</p>]]></paragraph>

<paragraph title="7.2.14." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS7C2">It is also important to categorise incidents in order to better manage allocation of resources to the containment and remediation of the incident.&nbsp; A three-tier categorisation is suggested:</p><ol>
<li>Critical: Incident affecting critical systems or information with potential to impact operations, revenue or customers.</li>
<li>Serious: Incident affecting noncritical systems or information, impact on operations, revenue or customers.&nbsp; Employee investigations that are time sensitive should typically be classified at this level.</li>
<li>Low: Possible incident affecting noncritical systems.&nbsp; Incidents or employee investigations that are not time sensitive.&nbsp; Long term investigations requiring extensive research and/or detailed forensic work.</li>
</ol>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="7.2.15." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS7C2">Factors that assist in determining the severity of an incident include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Whether the incident affects a single agency or multiple agencies;</li>
<li>Functional impact of the incident (availability);</li>
<li>Information impact of the incident (confidentiality, integrity);</li>
<li>Recoverability from the incident;</li>
<li>Whether a breach of personal information held by the agency has occurred;</li>

<chapter title="10. Infrastructure"><section title="10.1. Cable Management Fundamentals"><subsection title="Objective"><paragraph title="10.1.1." ><![CDATA[<p>Cable management systems are designed to support the integration of systems across government facilities, assist maintenance and engineering changes, as well as minimise the opportunity for tampering or unauthorised changes to cable systems.</p>]]></paragraph>
 </subsection>
<subsection title="Context"> <block title="Scope"><paragraph title="10.1.2." ><![CDATA[<p>This section covers information relating to cable distribution systems used in facilities within New Zealand. When designing cable management systems, <a title="Cable Labelling and Registration" href="http://nzism.gcsb.govt.nz/ism-document#Section-13749">Section 10.5 - Cable Labelling and Registration</a> and <a title="Cable Patching" href="http://nzism.gcsb.govt.nz/ism-document#Section-13786">Section 10.6 - Cable Patching</a> of this chapter also apply.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Applicability of controls within this section"><paragraph title="10.1.3." ><![CDATA[<p>The controls within this section are applicable only to communications infrastructure located within facilities in New Zealand. For deployable platforms or facilities outside of New Zealand Emanation Security Threat Assessments (Section 10.7) of this chapter of this manual MUST be consulted.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Common implementation scenarios"><paragraph title="10.1.4." ><![CDATA[<p>This section provides common requirements for non-shared facilities. Specific requirements for facilities shared between agencies and facilities shared with non-government entities can be found in subsequent sections of this chapter.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Red/Black Concept and Cable Separation"><paragraph title="10.1.5." ><![CDATA[<p>The <strong>RED/BLACK</strong> concept is the separation of electrical and electronic circuits, devices, equipment cables, connectors, components and systems that transmit store or process national security information from non-national security information. The <strong>RED/BLACK</strong> concept is sometimes described as <strong>RED/BLACK</strong> architecture or <strong>RED/BLACK</strong> engineering.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="10.1.6." ><![CDATA[<p>The <strong>RED/BLACK</strong> concept should not be confused with the generic description HIGH/LOW or HIGH SIDE/LOW SIDE.  In this context, HIGH refers to systems <strong>classified</strong> CONFIDENTIAL and above and LOW refers to systems <strong>classified</strong> RESTRICTED and below.  While these concepts are similar and often used interchangeably, it is important to recognise that information does not usually change classification. The signal or transmission, however, may transit both <strong>RED</strong> and <strong>BLACK</strong> systems in order to reach its intended destination. It is important to note that systems carrying a particular classification may also carry information at <strong>ALL </strong>lower classifications <strong>BUT NOT</strong> any higher classifications.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="10.1.7." ><![CDATA[<p>An example is the use of radio transmissions or Wi-Fi where the information may hold a HIGH classification and originate in <strong>RED</strong> equipment but once transmission occurs the <strong>signal</strong> is <strong>BLACK</strong> as radio and Wi-Fi signals can be detected by anyone within range.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="10.1.8." ><![CDATA[<p>This also leads to the situation where some equipment may have both <strong>RED</strong> and <strong>BLACK</strong> elements.  Examples include Wi-Fi Access Points and encryption devices.  <strong>RED</strong> Information in a <strong>BLACK</strong> environment is invariably protected by encryption and a variety of technical countermeasures.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="10.1.9." ><![CDATA[<p>All cables with metal conductors (the signal carrier, the grounding element, the strengthening member or an armoured outer covering) can act as fortuitous signal conductors allowing signals to escape or to cross-contaminate other cables and signals.  This provides a path for the exploitation of signals, data and information.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="10.1.10." ><![CDATA[<p>A fundamental control is the separation of cables and related equipment with sufficient distance between them to prevent cross-contamination.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Cable trays"><paragraph title="10.1.11." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS10C1b">Where copper or a combination of copper and fibre cables are used, cable trays will provide separation, assist cable management and enhance cable protection.&nbsp; While preferable to separate RED cables of different&nbsp;systems for cable management purposes, the most important element is to maintain RED/BLACK separation.&nbsp;</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="10.1.12." ><![CDATA[<p>It is preferable that cable trays contain dividers.&nbsp; Some cable trays provide only a single receptacle for cables (no dividers).&nbsp;If dividers are not available, multi-core fibre cables should be used.&nbsp; Cables of similar classifications should be bundled.&nbsp; A typical cable tray layout with dividers is depicted below:</p>
<p><img src="/assets/NZISM/10__ResizedImageWzYwMCw0MTld.1.10-Cable-Trays.png" alt="" width="600" height="419" class="leftAlone ss-htmleditorfield-file image" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Catenary"><paragraph title="10.1.13." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS10C1b">The use of catenary (wire, rope, nylon cord or similar cable support mechanisms) is becoming more widespread in place of cable trays.  Care MUST be taken to maintain <strong>RED/BLACK</strong> separation if this method of cable support is used.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Earthing"><paragraph title="10.1.14." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS10C1b">It is important that any metal trays or metal catenary are earthed for both safety and to avoid creating any fortuitous conductors.  All earthing points MUST be equipotentially bonded.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Fibre optic cabling"><paragraph title="10.1.15." ><![CDATA[<p>Fibre optic cabling does not produce, and is not influenced by, electromagnetic emanations; as such it offers the highest degree of protection from electromagnetic emanation effects.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="10.1.16." ><![CDATA[<p>Many more fibres can be run per cable diameter than wired cables thereby reducing cable infrastructure costs. Fibre Optic cable is usually constructed with a glass core, cladding on the core and a further, colour coded coating. Multiple cores can be bundled into a single cable and multiple cables can be bundled into a high capacity cable. This is illustrated in Figures 1 below. Cables also have a central strength member of mylar or some similar high strength, non-conductive material</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="10.1.17." ><![CDATA[<p>Fibre cable is considered the best method to future proof against unforeseen threats.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="10.1.18." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS10C1b">Cable trays for fibre only cable may be of any suitable material.&nbsp; If metal trays are used they MUST be earthed.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Ribbon Fibre Optic Cable"><paragraph title="10.1.19." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS10C1b">In the context of this discussion, traditional and ribbon fibre optic cables are subject to identical controls, restrictions in installation and use and any operational caveats.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="10.1.20." ><![CDATA[<p>Unlike traditional beam optical cable, ribbon fibre optic cable is arranged into a strip.&nbsp; Because the ribbon contains only coated optical fibres, this type of cable takes up much less space and is generally lighter (weight) than individually buffered optical fibres.&nbsp; As a result, ribbon cables are denser than any other fibre cable design.&nbsp; They are ideal for applications where space is limited, such as in an existing conduit that has very little room left for an additional cable.&nbsp; Ribbon fibre optic cable is a convenient solution for space and weight challenges.</p><p><img class="leftAlone" style="width: 265px; height: 254px;" title="" src="assets/Uploads/Figure-2a-Typical-Ribbon-Cable.jpg" alt="" width="499" height="499">&nbsp;<img class="leftAlone" style="width: 261px; height: 248px;" title="" src="assets/NZISM/Figure-2b-Typical-Ribbon-Cable.jpg" alt="" width="317" height="300"></p><p class="NormS10C1b">Figure 2: Typical Ribbon Cable</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="10.1.21." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS10C1b">Ribbon cables enable the migration to high fibre count systems required to support high bandwidth applications including 10, 40 and 100Gb/s.  Ribbon cables are rarely used in long distance fibre optic trunk cable but are typically used in data centres, campus, commercial buildings and large industrial sites.  Fibre counts can range from 2 to over 1700.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="10.1.22." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS10C1b">The cable ribbons are coated optical fibres placed side by side, encapsulated in Mylar tape, similar to a miniature version of wire ribbons used in computer wiring.  A single ribbon many contain 4, 8, 12 or 24 optical fibres with ribbons stacked up to 22 high.  At present 12-fiber ribbons are readily accessible and identifiable with ribbon identification numbers, TIA-598 compliant fibre colour coding and are available with non-flame-retardant or formulated flame-retardant outer jacket.  They are also available in several configurations including all-dielectric, armoured and aerial self-supporting cables.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="10.1.23." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS10C1b">Because the cable profile is different to older round cable type, new cable strippers, cleavers, and fusion splicers are required for installation and maintenance.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="10.1.24." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS10C1b">Fibre optic ribbon cable comes in two basic configurations: loose tube ribbon cable and jacket ribbon.  Loose tube cables are where fibre ribbons are stacked on top of one another inside a loose-buffered tube.  This arrangement can hold several hundred fibres in close quarters. The buffer, strength members, and cable jacket carry any strain while the fibre ribbons move freely inside the buffer tube.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="10.1.25." ><![CDATA[<p>Jacket ribbon cable is similar to a regular tight-buffered cable, but it is elongated to contain a fibre ribbon. This type of cable typically features a small amount of strength member and a ripcord to tear through the jacket.</p>

<paragraph title="10.1.26." ><![CDATA[<p>Infrastructure cables contain multiple fibre ribbon units inside a central tube with dielectric strength members for tensile strength and colour coded fibres with individual ribbon unit ID numbers for clear identification.&nbsp; Ribbon fibre optic cables are available in configurations supporting high-speed, applications such as Gigabit Ethernet, 10 Gigabit Ethernet, Gigabit ATM and Fibre Channel.</p>

<block title="Armoured Fibre optic cabling"><paragraph title="10.1.27." ><![CDATA[<p>Some fibre optic cable also includes conductive metal cable strengtheners and conductive metal armoured sheaths which may be wire-wound or stainless steel mesh for external cable protection and steel wire cores as core strength members. This strengthening and armouring is conductive and specialist advice may be needed to avoid earth loops, cross-coupling, inductive coupling or the introduction of other compromising signals and currents. Fibre optic cable with metal cable strengtheners or conductive armoured sheaths is considered <em>unsuitable</em> for secure installations.</p>

<block title="Backbone"><paragraph title="10.1.28." ><![CDATA[<p>A backbone or core is the central cabling that connects the infrastructure (servers, databases, gateways, equipment and telecommunication rooms etc.) to local areas networks, workstations and other devices, such as MFD’s. Smaller networks may also be connected to the backbone.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="10.1.29." ><![CDATA[<p>A backbone can span a geographic area of any size including an office, a single building, multi-story buildings, campus, national and international infrastructure. In the context of the NZISM the term backbone generally refers to the central cabling within a building or a campus.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="10.1.30." ><![CDATA[<p>Backbones can be defined in terms of six criteria:</p><ul>
<li>transmission media;</li>
<li>topology;</li>
<li>security required;</li>
<li>access control;</li>
<li>transmission technique; </li>
<li>transmission speed and capability.</li>

</block>
<block title="TOP SECRET cabling"><paragraph title="10.1.31." ><![CDATA[<p>For TOP SECRET cabling the cable’s non-conductive protective sheath IS NOT considered to be a conduit. For TOP SECRET fibre optic cables with sub-units, the cable’s outer protective sheath IS considered to be a conduit.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Power Filters"><paragraph title="10.1.32." ><![CDATA[<p>A power filter is a device placed between an external power source and electronic devices.  It is used in order to attenuate external transients, conducted radio frequencies (RF) or electromagnetic interference (EMI) between the AC or DC power line and the equipment.  Filters can also reduce radiated interference to assist in managing emissions or susceptibility to interference.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="10.1.33." ><![CDATA[<p>The power lines entering an electronic device can act both as an antenna and as a low impedance conduction path for signals that exist inside the device.  These signals may couple into the power line, either through inductance or capacitance, from internal circuitry, other internal wiring or from other components such as transformers, coils or adjacently routed wires.  To a lesser degree, but still problematic, the power lines can also pickup induced current signals from magnetic fields inside the enclosure.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="10.1.34." ><![CDATA[<p>The purpose of power supply filters is to smooth the power supply and provide a degree of isolation from the external power supply for connected electronic devices.  RF/EMI filters are designed to reduce line - to - ground (common mode) interference, EMI and anomalous RF.  Best practice is to solve or suppress EMI and RF emissions at source, rather than after emission.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="10.1.35." ><![CDATA[<p>There are international and national regulations on frequencies and signal levels that a device is permitted to produce in order to minimise or prevent interference with other equipment.  Practically no modern equipment, with fast digital circuits and switch-mode power supply regulators can meet electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) requirements without efficient filtering, particularly when operating in close proximity.  While most devices are designed by manufacturers to meet regulation, not all devices filter EMI or RF to levels acceptable for secure environments.  It may be necessary to use a power line filter to keep signals inside the enclosure as much as possible and keep any generated signals to less than the legal or required limits for conducted emissions.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="10.1.36." ><![CDATA[<p>Power filters have a variety of capabilities depending on their specification.  It is important the filters are selected correctly for the power supply, expected load and required attenuation capacity. It is important to note that an Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) is NOT considered an RF/EMI filter.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="10.1.37." ><![CDATA[<p>Common usage of filters is for computer systems, laboratory and testing equipment, medical devices, consumer electronics, and to protect any equipment where good quality power supply and protection of the electronic devices and data is required.  Devices can be within buildings, vehicle, ships, aircraft or portable.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="10.1.38." ><![CDATA[<p>Power filters often include EMC/ RFI filters which channel emissions to earth to prevent them from being conducted back down the supply cables.  This can be detected as an earth leakage current which may cause Residual Current Devices (RCDs) to trip.  This problem can be corrected by using the correct specification of power filter or installing low leakage current devices.  Agencies should consult the GCSB if such problems occur.</p>]]></paragraph>

<block title="Rack Layout and Cable Management"><paragraph title="10.6.14." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS10C6">Standardised rack layouts and cable management are important for engineering support, security, equipment cooling and to minimise accidental or unnecessary outages.  Many data centres will dictate a hotside (hot air out) and coldside (cold air in).  The hotside is generally the rear of equipment and the rack.  The coldside is generally the front panel of equipment and rack.  The ducting of hot/cold air is often also standardised. </p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="10.6.15." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS10C6"> Standardising rack layout and cable management minimises problems caused by:</p><ul>
<li>Accidently not being able to locate end points of network and patch cables without tracing the cable end to end.</li>
<li>Physically impeding access to equipment.</li>
<li>Positioning of equipment and cables such that airflow (cooling) is impeded.  As the density of equipment in racks increases, cooling becomes an increasingly important factor.  Poor rack design combined with dense rack utilization can contribute to internal rack temperatures significantly higher than ambient room temperatures.</li>
</ul>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="10.6.16." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS10C6">Standardising rack layout and cable management also assists in the maintenance of separation and segregation between RED/BLACK systems.</p>]]></paragraph>

<paragraph title="10.6.18." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS10C6">In small installations (typically single workstation) shared racks are unavoidable.&nbsp; In such cases a shared rack configuration is permissible <strong>provided</strong> separation elements and controls are properly implemented.&nbsp; Extra care must be taken to avoid accidental cross-connection of systems.&nbsp; The following illustrates a standardised shared rack configuration where RED/BLACK and power systems are separated:</p><p class="NormS10C6"><img class="leftAlone" title="" src="assets/NZISM/10.6.18-Standardised-Rack-Configuration-updated-2020.PNG" alt="" width="432" height="479"></p><p class="NormS10C6"><strong>Figure 11: Separation of RED/BLACK</strong></p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Separation of Cable Runs"><paragraph title="10.6.19." ><![CDATA[<p>In order to maintain the integrity of <strong>RED</strong>/<strong>BLACK</strong> separation, cables for power and data should be separately bundled as power <strong>RED</strong> or <strong>BLACK</strong> and data <strong>RED</strong> or <strong>BLACK</strong>.  Cables should be run with as much distance between the bundles as can be practically managed, within the constraints of cable feeds and rack configuration.  Ideally <strong>RED</strong> and <strong>BLACK</strong> should be on opposite sides of the rack. Cables should be no longer than required to avoid overlength cables compromising separation.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Access to BLACK equipment and components by uncleared staff and contractors"><paragraph title="10.6.20." ><![CDATA[<p>In some instances there may be a requirement for external technical or other uncleared personnel to access <strong>BLACK</strong> equipment and components for servicing, repair or replacement.  Care must be taken to maintain the integrity of <strong>RED</strong> equipment and components.  This can be especially problematic in shared rack configurations as described above.</p><p>This requirement should be identified before installation takes place and segregation measures implemented.  Ideally physical separation of <strong>BLACK</strong> from <strong>RED</strong> is the best solution, recognising however, this may not always be possible or practical. Other solutions may include, for example, a shared rack that has two doors with the <strong>RED</strong> door locked and alarmed so that <strong>BLACK</strong> equipment can be accessed without compromising the security of <strong>RED</strong> equipment.  Discussion with the GCSB may identify other practical solutions.</p>]]></paragraph>

<subsection title="Context"> <block title="Scope"><paragraph title="10.8.2." ><![CDATA[<p>This section includes discussion of the principles of separation and segregation as network design and network architecture characteristics.  It also discusses how IP addresses can be used to support these principles for improved security of larger or multi-classification agency systems.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Background"><paragraph title="10.8.3." ><![CDATA[<p>The larger the network, the more difficult it is to protect.  A large, unsegmented network presents a large attack surface with greater susceptibility to the rapid spread and dissemination of system faults, weaknesses, vulnerabilities and attacks.  In a non-segmented network, traffic and applications generally have access to the entire network. If a fault occurs or an attacker gains entry, the fault or attacker can move laterally through the network causing disruption, network outages and enabling access to critical operational or classified data.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="10.8.4." ><![CDATA[<p>A large network is also more difficult to monitor and control.  Segmenting the network limits an attacker’s ability to move through the network by preventing lateral movement between zones.  Segmentation also enhances the ability to detect, monitor, control, isolate and correct faults.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="10.8.5." ><![CDATA[<p>A fundamental construct in the management of risk in networks is that of Trust Zones and Trust Boundaries. &nbsp;A Trust Zone is a zoning construct based on levels of trust, classification, information asset value and essential information security. &nbsp;A Trust Boundary is the interface between two or more Trust Zones. Trust Zones use the principles of separation and segregation to manage sensitive information assets and ensure security policies are consistently applied to all assets in a particular Trust Zone. &nbsp;Refer also to <a title="Cloud computing" href="http://nzism.gcsb.govt.nz/ism-document#Section-17217">Section 22.1 – Cloud Computing</a> and <a title="Virtualisation" href="http://nzism.gcsb.govt.nz/ism-document#Section-17306">Section 22.2 – Virtualisation</a>.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Separation and Segregation"><paragraph title="10.8.6." ><![CDATA[<p>Separation and Segregation are determined by system function and the sensitivity of the data the system stores, processes and transmits.  One common example is placing systems that require a connection to the Internet into a demilitarized zone (DMZ) that is separated and segregated (isolated) from more sensitive systems. Another example is the use of compartments.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="10.8.7." ><![CDATA[<p>Separation and Segregation limits the ability of an intruder to exploit a vulnerability with the intent of elevating privileges to gain access to more sensitive systems on the internal network.  VLANs may be used to further separate systems by controlling access and providing segregation thus giving additional protection.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="10.8.8." ><![CDATA[<p>Network segmentation is an effective strategy for protecting access to key data assets, and impeding the lateral movement of system faults, threats and malicious activity.  Segregation has the following benefits:</p><ul>
<li>Enhanced performance: with fewer hosts per subnet, there is a reduced signalling and traffic overhead allowing more bandwidth for data communication.</li>
<li>Improved security: with less signalling traffic going through all network segments, it is more difficult for an attacker to analyse the addressing scheme and network structure.  Failures in one segment are less likely to propagate and more robust access control can be established and enforced.</li>
</ul>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="10.8.9." ><![CDATA[<p>Effective segregation also requires:</p><ul>
<li>Specialised knowledge: networks may support many devices with complex policies and rule sets.  Support staff must be properly educated and trained to ensure the network segmentation is maintained.</li>
<li>Administrative effort: changes in infrastructure, such as new applications and new technologies, can extend the time required to make changes and ensure the integrity of network segments.</li>
<li>Infrastructure Investment: segregation may require more equipment, new equipment with advanced functionalities, or specific software to deal with multiple segments.  These requirements should be considered during budget planning.</li>
</ul>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="ISO 27001 and ISO 27002 implementation recommendations for network segregation"><paragraph title="10.8.10." ><![CDATA[<p>These ISO Standards require the implementation of network segregation.  In particular they recommend that groups of information services, users, and information systems are segregated on networks.  Specific recommendations are summarised below:</p><ul>
<li>Divide large networks into separate network domains (segments);</li>
<li>Consider physical and logical segregation;</li>
<li>Define domain perimeters;</li>
<li>Define traffic rules between domains;</li>
<li>Use authentication, encryption, and user-level network access control technologies;</li>
<li>Consider integration of the organisation’s network and segments with those of business partners.</li>
</ul>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="10.8.11." ><![CDATA[<p>The following structures and techniques should be considered:</p><ul>
<li><strong>Criteria-based segmentation</strong>: Pre-define rules to establish perimeters and create new segments in order to reduce unnecessary redesign and future administrative overheads. &nbsp;Examples of criteria are trust level (e.g., external public segment, staff segment, server segment, database segment, suppliers segment, etc.), organisational unit (e.g., Operations, Service Desk, Outreach, etc.), and combinations (e.g., external public access).</li>
<li><strong>Use of physical and logical segmentation:</strong> Depending upon the risk level identified in the risk assessment, it may be necessary to use physically separated infrastructures to protect the organisation’s information and assets (e.g., classified data flowing through a dedicated fibre), or you may use solutions based on logical segmentation like Virtual Private Network (VPN).</li>
<li><strong>Access rules for traffic flowing</strong>: Traffic between segments, including those of permitted external parties, should be controlled according to the need to access information. &nbsp;Gateways should be configured based on information classification and risk assessment. A specific case of access control applies to wireless networks, since they have poor perimeter definition. &nbsp;The recommendation is to treat wireless communication as an external connection until the traffic can reach a proper wired gateway before granting access to internal network segments. Refer also to <a title="Gateway Security" href="http://nzism.gcsb.govt.nz/ism-document#Chapter-16567">Chapter 19 – Gateway Security</a>.</li>

<subsection title="Network Design"><paragraph title="10.8.12" ><![CDATA[<p>A poorly designed network has increased support costs, reduced availability, security risks, and limited support for new applications and solutions. &nbsp;Less-than-optimal performance affects end users and access to central resources. Some of the issues that stem from a poorly designed network may include the following:</p><ul>
<li><strong>Failure domains</strong>: One of the most important reasons to implement an effective network design is to minimise the spread and extent of faults. &nbsp;When Layer 2 and Layer 3 boundaries are not clearly deﬁned, failure in one network area can have a far-reaching effect.</li>
<li><strong>Broadcast domains</strong>: Broadcasts exist in every network. &nbsp;Many applications and network operations require broadcasts to function correctly; therefore, it is not possible to eliminate them completely. &nbsp;In the same way that avoiding failure domains involves clearly deﬁning boundaries, broadcast domains should have clear boundaries and include an optimal number of devices to minimise the negative impact of broadcasts.</li>
<li><strong>MAC unicast ﬂooding</strong>: Some switches limit unicast frame forwarding to ports that are associated with the speciﬁc unicast address. &nbsp;However, when frames arrive at a destination MAC address that is not recorded in the MAC table, they are ﬂooded out of the switch ports in the same VLAN except for the port that received the frame. &nbsp;This behaviour is called unknown MAC unicast ﬂooding.</li>
<li>Because this type of ﬂooding causes excessive trafﬁc on all the switch ports, network interface cards (NIC) must contend with a larger number of frames on the wire. &nbsp;When data is propagated on a connection or network segment for which it was not intended, security can be compromised.</li>
<li><strong>Multicast trafﬁc on ports where it is not intended</strong>: IP multicast is a technique that allows IP trafﬁc to be propagated from one source to a multicast group that is identiﬁed by a single IP and MAC destination-group address pair. &nbsp;Similar to unicast ﬂooding and broadcasting, multicast frames are ﬂooded out all the switch ports. A robust design allows for the containment of multicast frames while allowing them to be functional.</li>
<li><strong>Difﬁculty in management and support</strong>: Trafﬁc ﬂows can be difficult to identify in a poorly designed network. &nbsp;This can make support, maintenance, and problem resolution time-consuming and difficult as well as creating security risks.</li>
<li><strong>Possible security vulnerabilities</strong>: A switched network that has been designed with little attention to security requirements at the access layer can compromise the integrity of the entire network.</li>
<li><strong>Criteria-based segmentation</strong>: Pre-define rules to establish perimeters and create new segments in order to reduce unnecessary redesign and future administrative overheads. &nbsp;Examples of criteria are trust level (e.g., external public segment, staff segment, server segment, database segment, suppliers segment, etc.), organisational unit (e.g., Operations, Service Desk, Outreach, etc.), and combinations (e.g., external public access).</li>
</ul>]]></paragraph>
 <block title="Design Implementation"><paragraph title="10.8.13." ><![CDATA[<p>To assist in the implementation of separation and segregation as network design and architectural principles, the following aspects should be considered:</p><ul>
<li>Classification;</li>
<li>Security Zones;</li>
<li>IP Address Management;</li>
<li>Central Information Repository;</li>
<li>Private Use of Reserved Addresses;</li>
<li>Devices with Default IP Addresses; and</li>
<li>Connector types and cable colours.</li>
</ul>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Classification"><paragraph title="10.8.14." ><![CDATA[<p>Classified systems should, by definition, be segregated.  This is particularly important where network elements have access to compartments and compartmented data.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="10.8.15." ><![CDATA[<p>Ideally compartmented elements of systems should be segregated and separated from the main network.  This may include the use of a reserved address space, monitored to detect violations or unauthorised attempts to connect to compartments or to access compartmented data.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Security Zones"><paragraph title="10.8.16." ><![CDATA[<p>A security zone is a group of one or more physical or virtual firewall interfaces and the network segments connected to the zone’s interfaces.  Protection for each zone is individually specified and controlled so that each zone receives the specific protections it requires according to classification, endorsement, compartment and sensitivity of data.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="IP Address Management"><paragraph title="10.8.17." ><![CDATA[<p>The fundamental goal of an IP addressing scheme is to ensure network devices are uniquely addressed.  IP Address Schemes are a fundamental part of any network’s security architecture and should support network separation and segregation.  There are a number of techniques to assist in separating and segregating network elements. It is also useful to consider how to segregate and control network traffic through:</p><ul>
<li>Defined network perimeters and boundaries; and</li>
<li>Defined network traffic rules.</li>
</ul>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="10.8.18." ><![CDATA[<p>A well-structured IP addressing scheme promotes the ability to quickly identify node properties from an IP address which assist in network management and fault finding and rectification.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Address Block Allocation"><paragraph title="10.8.19." ><![CDATA[<p>There are two main difficulties when assigning address blocks for types of devices.  First is that over time there is insufficient provision for additional devices and network growth.  When the allocated address block is exhausted, the addressing scheme is compromised (broken). The second is that you have a small number of devices in an address block, but are running out of addresses in other parts of the network.  If you “borrow” from a pre-assigned address range, the addressing scheme is also compromised.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="10.8.20." ><![CDATA[<p>Internal IP address ranges are defined by the IETF. &nbsp;Commonly known as RFC 1918 addresses, the most recent RFC is 6761. &nbsp;These RFC’s define private IP address ranges which cannot be used for external (Internet) IP addressing. &nbsp;Three address ranges (blocks) are defined:</p>
<table class="table-main">

<paragraph title="10.8.21." ><![CDATA[<p>IPv4 addresses are 32-bit binary addresses, divided into 4-Octets and normally represented in a decimal format.  An example of IPv4 address is 192.168.100.10.  IPv6 addresses are so much larger than IPv4 addresses and impractical to clearly represent in decimals.  IPv6 addresses are usually represented in hexadecimal numbers, separated by a colon.  An example of an IPv6 address is 2001:0DB8:0000:0002:0022:2217:FF3B:118C.  Private IPv6 addresses are specified in RFC 4193</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="10.8.22." ><![CDATA[<p>Private addressing is a means of distinguishing networks, assisting in separation and segregation.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Private use of reserved addresses"><paragraph title="10.8.23." ><![CDATA[<p>Some IP addresses have been reserved in IETF standards.  Despite official warnings, some organisations use parts of the reserved IP address space for their internal networks where address space is exhausted or poorly designed.  This creates conflicts with devices and signalling traffic protocols which can create network faults, anomalies and network outages. This practice is strongly discouraged.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Devices which have default IP addresses"><paragraph title="10.8.24." ><![CDATA[<p>Some devices are supplied with default IP addresses.  If using the IETF RFC 1918 addressing protocol (e.g. 10.0.x.x) some devices may have been allocated the same (duplicate) IP address.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="10.8.25." ><![CDATA[<p>It is important to change default addresses to new addresses that conform with the addressing scheme selected for the agency.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="DHCP"><paragraph title="10.8.26." ><![CDATA[<p>In theory, there is only one network device that absolutely needs a true static address, the DHCP server.  In practice, it is preferable to assign address blocks to major groups of devices for control, fault isolation and security purposes.  Traditionally static devices are provided with a reserved address. These devices may include:</p><ul>
<li>DCHP Server;</li>
<li>Gateway devices;</li>
<li>Firewalls;</li>
<li>Routers; and</li>
<li>Switches.</li>
</ul>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="10.8.27." ><![CDATA[<p>The majority of other devices can be allocated a DHCP address.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="10.8.28." ><![CDATA[<p>It is important to identify the essential device groups using a risk assessment, operational characteristics, level of security, system classification and other relevant architectural features, business requirements and operational constraints.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Connector Types and Cable Colours"><paragraph title="10.8.29." ><![CDATA[<p>Cable management is discussed in detail earlier in this chapter. &nbsp;In particular note the discussion (<a href="http://nzism.gcsb.govt.nz/ism-document#Paragraph-13531">10.1.4</a>) of Red/Black concepts which includes separation of electrical and electronic circuits, devices, equipment cables, connectors and systems that transmit store or process national security information (Red) from non-national security information (Black)</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="10.8.30." ><![CDATA[<p>Wherever practical and possible, connectors for systems of different classifications should be distinct and be selected to avoid accidental cross-connection of systems of different classifications.  This can be achieved through the use of colour and keyed connectors where the colour and keying is different for each classification level or compartment (refer also to 10.1.30 and 10.6.6).</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Central Information Repository"><paragraph title="10.8.31." ><![CDATA[<p>Creating a central repository of all the information on networks, IP addresses and devices, is critical to maintaining control of the network.  The challenge with traditional tools is that there are often specific tools for each category of devices: one system to track virtual machines, one system to track wireless users, one system to track Windows servers, one system to track Linux machines, etc.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="10.8.32." ><![CDATA[<p>A single repository where all the data relevant to networks, hosts, servers, dynamic clients, and virtual environments can be tracked and synchronised is essential for larger networks.  The ability to search across all this information will enable network teams to quickly track changing network landscapes and rapidly troubleshoot issues as they arise. In addition, business data related to a network resource helps bind together the logical network construct and the reality of IT resources.</p>]]></paragraph>

 </subsection>
<subsection title="Context"><paragraph title="11.1.2." ><![CDATA[<p>Bluetooth radios are commonly found in end user devices, including laptops, mobile phones, and peripherals such as speakers, headphones, keyboards, and mice. More recently Bluetooth has been integrated into medical devices and personal devices.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="11.1.3." ><![CDATA[<p>It is important to be aware of all risks associated with Bluetooth technology. The specific threats to Bluetooth communications, that the controls in this section address, relate to are:</p>
<ul>
<li>eavesdropping on the Bluetooth communications between paired devices, and&nbsp;</li>
<li>connection interception attacks that leverage the network communications channel (including during establishment) of Bluetooth devices.</li>
</ul>]]></paragraph>
 </subsection>
<subsection title="Background"><paragraph title="11.1.4." ><![CDATA[<p>The Bluetooth specification has evolved over time and is regularly updated. Version 4.0 of the specification introduced Bluetooth Low Energy (LE) which offers a different feature set than the original Bluetooth Basic Rate/Enhanced Data Rate (BR/EDR) standard. Version 4.1 and 4.2 of the specification introduced enhanced security features for Bluetooth BR/EDR and LE respectively.&nbsp;</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="11.1.5." ><![CDATA[<p>Determining the security level being provided depends on several factors, including the capabilities and Bluetooth version supported by the devices being paired together. The actual security provided between devices is a combination of:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">a. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;the version of the Bluetooth specification supported by each device,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">b. &nbsp; &nbsp; the capabilities of the devices to accept user input (eg, through a keyboard, or camera) and to display output (eg, through a screen or character display), and</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">c. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;whether the devices are using Bluetooth BR/EDR or Bluetooth LE.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="11.1.6." ><![CDATA[<p>The following table summarises the security protections expected based on the pairing Bluetooth device capabilities where devices are Bluetooth BR/EDR using Secure Connections (version 4.1 or later) or Bluetooth LE using Secure Connections (version 4.2 or later) – refer to NIST SP 800-121 REV.2 Guide to Bluetooth.</p>

<subsection title="Context"> <block title="Scope"><paragraph title="11.5.2." ><![CDATA[<p>This section covers information relating to the use of personal wearable devices, fitness devices, smart watches, devices embedding in clothing and similar wearable devices.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="11.5.3." ><![CDATA[<p>These devices can use RF in various parts of the spectrum to communicate including Wi-Fi, cellular, satellite, RFID, NFC and Bluetooth frequencies as well as providing data storage capability, audio and video recording and USB connectivity. All such wearable or mobile devices are considered to be transmitters.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="11.5.4." ><![CDATA[<p>Personal wearable devices can be equipped with a variety of capabilities including smart phone pairing, internet connectivity, cameras, speakerphones, audio and video recording and remote control. Some devices (for example Narrative and Autographer) will automatically take snapshots at intervals during the day. In some cases the snapshots are geotagged.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="11.5.5." ><![CDATA[<p>Such devices are also susceptible to Internet malware and exploits. All risks related to the use of the Internet will apply to these devices.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="11.5.6." ><![CDATA[<p>Merely disabling the capabilities described above is not a sufficient mitigation and is not acceptable, posing a high risk of compromise, whether intentional or accidental. The device MUST NOT have such capabilities installed if the device is to enter a secure area.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="11.5.7." ><![CDATA[<p>There is a wide variety of devices now available with upgrades and new models appearing frequently. There are many hundreds of models with a variety of custom operating systems and programmes and other applications. Some industry surveys and predications are forecasting explosive growth in the use of wearable devices, reaching over 100 million devices by 2020. Checking the capabilities and vulnerabilities of each device and subsequent security testing or validation will be an onerous task for agencies and may be infeasible.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Key Risk Areas"><paragraph title="11.5.8." ><![CDATA[<p>Personal wearable devices are not only about the technological aspects, the human factor is equally important. Users often forget about personal information security and their own safety, which enables social engineering attacks on the devices. The main protective measure for users is awareness, but even the <em>trust-but-verify</em> rule is not completely reliable in this situation. Accordingly, the information gathered by wearable devices should be appropriately secured to maintain privacy and personal security.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="11.5.9." ><![CDATA[<p>There are four important risk groups to be considered when managing personal wearable devices:</p>
<ol>
<li>Data leaks and breaches;</li>
<li>Network security compromises;</li>
<li>Personal information leaks; and</li>
<li>Privacy violations.</li>
</ol>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Personal Information"><paragraph title="11.5.10." ><![CDATA[<p>In most cases, the protection of personal information will be the responsibility of the individual. In cases where the use of devices is permitted under a medical exemption, agencies MAY be required to ensure that devices that collect and store data comply with relevant regulation and guidance, such as the Privacy Act.</p>]]></paragraph>

They are useful tools in improving logistics, profoundly changing cost structures for business, and improving levels of safety and authenticity in a wide range of applications such as access control, passports, payment cards, vehicle immobilisers, toll roads, pharmaceuticals tracking, management of high value items and weapons control. RFID tags are now produced in a wide variety of types and sizes, from the size of a grain of rice or printed on paper to much larger devices incorporating a battery or other power supply.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="11.6.5." ><![CDATA[<p>Unlike bar coding systems, RFID devices can communicate without requiring line of sight and over distances ranging from a few centimetres to kilometres. They can be equipped with sensors to collect data on temperature changes, sudden shocks, humidity or other factors affecting product safety and quality.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="11.6.6." ><![CDATA[<p>RFID devices typically use radio signals to transmit identifying information such as product or serial numbers, manufacture date, origin and batch number. This identifying information is invariably in the form of an Electronic Product Code (EPC) following the standards and conventions published by GS1. GS1 is a global group that also develops standards for other identifiers such as barcodes. The GS1 standards and conventions are now incorporated into ISO standards, see references table&nbsp;at <a href="http://nzism.gcsb.govt.nz/ism-document#Paragraph-14247">11.6.57</a>.</p>]]></paragraph>

<paragraph title="11.6.8." ><![CDATA[<p>RFID devices are often referred to as “tags”. Passive tags are unpowered and harvest power from the RFID reader. Active tags incorporate a power supply, usually a battery. Tags are produced in Classes 0 to 5 and are now generally produced to Generation 2 specifications. The EPCGen2 standard for Class 1 tags focuses on reliability and efficiency but supports only very basic security. Features of the Gen 2 specification include:</p><ul>
<li><strong>a 96 bit EPC number</strong> with read/write capability and can be designated used for other data ;</li>
<li><strong>a 32/64 bit tag identifier</strong> (TID) – identifies the manufacturer of the tag, also with read/write capabilities; </li>
<li><strong>32 bit kill password</strong> to permanently disable the tag; </li>
<li><strong>32 bit access password</strong> to lock the read/write characteristics of the tag and also set the tag for disabling ;</li>
<li><strong>User memory</strong> – dependant on the manufacturer and can be as little as 0 bits to 2048 bits. Larger user memory is in development.</li>
</ul>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="11.6.9." ><![CDATA[<p>The distance from which a tag can be read is termed the read range. A read range will depend on a number of factors, including the radio frequency used for reader/tag/reader communication, the size and orientation of the antennae, the power output of the reader, and whether the tags have a battery or other power supply. Battery-powered tags typically have a read range of 100 meters (approximately 300 feet) although this can extend to kilometres under favourable conditions. It is possible that powered RFID tags, typically used on cargo containers, railway wagons, vehicles and other large assets, could be read from a satellite if there is little background “noise” and the broadcast signal is sufficiently powerful.</p>]]></paragraph>

<block title="Smart Cards"><paragraph title="11.6.14." ><![CDATA[<p>Smart cards typically comprise an embedded integrated circuit incorporating a microchip with internal memory, a read-only CSN (Card Serial Number) or a UID (User Identification). The card connects to a reader with direct physical contact or a contactless radio frequency (RFID) interface. With an embedded microchip, smart cards can store large amounts of data, carry out on-card functions (such as encryption and authentication) and interact intelligently with a smart card reader. Smart card technology can be found in a variety of form factors, including plastic cards, key fobs, watches, subscriber identification modules used in mobile phones, and USB-based tokens. Smart cards are widely used in payment card (debit and credit cards and electronic wallets) and access control systems.</p>]]></paragraph>

<subsection title="Threats and Vulnerabilities"><paragraph title="11.6.18" ><![CDATA[<p>Some important characteristics of RFID, inherent in the design and properties of the technology are:</p><ul>
<li>RFID tags are powered by the field emitted by an RFID reader, so whenever a tag is placed in a reader field it is activated and available. In general terms, class 0 and class 1 tags cannot be powered off, only permanently deactivated;</li>
<li>RFID tags automatically respond to reader interactions without explicit control of the tag owner, so RFID tags can be operated without their owner’s consent;</li>
<li>It is trivial to establish a communication with an RFID tag and there is no visual confirmation of a tag/reader interaction (i.e., no physical connection or manual operation is required), so it is possible to interact with an RFID tag without being detected.</li>
</ul>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="11.6.19" ><![CDATA[<p>Specific threats and vulnerabilities in the use of RFID technologies include:</p><ul>
<li><strong>Legitimate data-mining</strong>: This risk predates the use of RFID technology, but the volume of data provided by RFID tags, loyalty cards, Near Field Communication (NFC) for bank cards and for electronic wallets increases the risk. Some data collection methods keep to ethical use of data-mining techniques to discover the characteristics and habits of an individual or an organisation. This can pose a business intelligence risk. At times, however, this may challenge the bounds of privacy and data ownership. For example, customer loyalty card data used to discover medical information about an individual or RFID tags to track shipments or deliveries to an organisation by a competitor.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Eavesdropping and Data theft</strong>: This risk is similar to the data-mining risk but employs unethical and possibly illegal methods of data collection or obtaining data for nefarious or malicious purposes. RFID tags are designed to broadcast information and data theft by easily concealable RFID scanners is technically trivial. Data theft can pose a risk to business processes.</li>
<li><strong>Skimming</strong>: Occurs when an unauthorised reader gains access to data stored on a token. This type of attack is particularly dangerous where contactless access or payment cards are used.</li>
<li><strong>Relay Attacks</strong>: Relay attacks use eavesdropping to intercept legitimate tag/reader transmissions and relay these to a device at some distance from the legitimate tag. The device can then behave as the genuine tag. Again this type of attack is particularly dangerous where contactless access or payment cards are used.</li>
<li><strong>Insert Attacks</strong>: Insert attacks insert system commands where normal data is expected and relies on a lack of data validation. It is possible that a tag can have legitimate data replaced by a malicious command.</li>
<li><strong>Tag Cloning</strong>: Clones replicate the functionality of legitimate tags and can be used to access controlled areas, abuse private data, or make an unauthorised electronic transaction. Tag authentication using a challenge-response protocol is a defence against cloning as the information that attackers can obtain through the air interface (such as by eavesdropping) is insufficient to provide a legitimate response. The design of the tag can also incorporate measures at the circuit manufacturing stage to protect tags from duplication by reverse engineering.</li>
<li><strong>Data corruption</strong>: Most RFID tags are rewritable by design. This feature may be locked (turning the tag into a write-once, read-many device) or left active, depending on application and security sensitivity. For example, in libraries, the RFID tags are frequently left unlocked for the convenience of librarians in reusing the tags on different books or to track check-ins and check-outs. If tags are not protected, it creates an opportunity for malicious users to overwrite data, typically in the theft of high-value goods by marking them as low-value items or in the case of weapons monitoring, changing the weapon identification.</li>
<li><strong>Shipment or People tracking</strong>: While RFID tags are designed to assist in stock control and supply chain management, unauthorised tracking of shipments or of people is undesirable and may even be dangerous. It is possible to follow individuals carrying tags using several techniques, including placing fake readers at building access points, deploying unauthorised readers near legitimate readers and creating relay points along expected routes.</li>
<li><strong>Tag Blocking</strong>: This is a form of denial of service by introducing a blocker tag which is designed to simulate all possible tags in an allocated range. This causes readers to continually perform multiple reads on non-existent and non-responsive tags. Blocker tags are sometimes used where privacy or confidentiality are required.</li>
<li><strong>Denial of Service (DOS)</strong>: Also known as flooding attacks where a signal is flooded with more data than it is designed to handle. Similar in many respects to RF Jamming.</li>
</ul>]]></paragraph>
 <block title="Attack Vectors"><paragraph title="11.6.20." ><![CDATA[<p>Attack vectors for RFID devices include:</p><ul>
<li>interception of legitimate transmissions;</li>
<li>interception of authorised reader data by an unauthorised device;</li>
<li>unauthorised access to tags and readers;</li>
<li>rogue/cloned tags;</li>
<li>rogue and unauthorised RFID readers; </li>
<li>side-channel attacks (timing measurements, electromagnetic radiations etc.); </li>
<li>attacks on back-end systems;</li>
<li>jamming of legitimate signals.</li>
</ul>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="11.6.21." ><![CDATA[<p>Because RFID devices incorporate antennas, there is a possibility of radiation hazards from high –powered devices, particularly active tags and readers. It is important to note however that these cases are rare, occur in high powered devices only and that the vast majority of RFID devices do not pose radiation hazards. Related hazards include electromagnetic radiation hazards to personnel (HERP), fuel (HERF) and ordnance (HERO).</p>]]></paragraph>

<block title="Keyed-Hash Message Authentication Code (HMAC)"><paragraph title="11.6.28." ><![CDATA[<p>HMAC is a protocol where both an RFID reader and RFID tag share a common secret key that can be used in combination with a hash algorithm to provide one-way or mutual authentication between tag and reader. When HMAC is applied to messages, it also assures the integrity of data in the messages.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="11.6.29." ><![CDATA[<p>HMAC is not specified in any RFID standard, but the capability is generally available in vendor products. HMAC is often used where the risk of eavesdropping is high and passwords alone are considered to offer an inadequate authentication mechanism. This will be determined by the risk assessment. HMAC is also used where applications require evidence of a tag’s authenticity.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Digital Signatures"><paragraph title="11.6.30." ><![CDATA[<p>Digital signatures are compatible with existing RFID tag standards. In authenticated RFID systems, tags can receive, store, and transmit digital signatures with existing read and write commands because the complexity is managed by readers or back-end systems. However, the use of digital signatures to support authentication of readers to tags would require tags to support relatively complex cryptographic functions, beyond the capacity of common tag designs.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="11.6.31." ><![CDATA[<p>In addition, digital signatures that are not generated by the tag itself are subject to replay attacks. An adversary could query a tag to obtain its evidence of authenticity (i.e., the digital signature created by a previous reader) and then replicate that data on a cloned tag. Consequently, password or symmetric key authentication systems likely will support tag access control, as opposed to tag authenticity verification, for the immediate future.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Encryption"><paragraph title="11.6.32." ><![CDATA[<p>Data stored in the memory of an RFID tag is intended to be freely shared with the various tag users (manufacturers, stock controllers, shipping agents, etc.). Only an RFID reader is required to access the data which raises the question of data security. Memory and computational power of an RFID tag is limited, but data elements can be password-protected or reserved for nominated usage. Several levels of authorisation (read-only, read and write, delete, etc.) can be determined. It is also advisable to encrypt the data entered onto the tag, the encryption/decryption taking place at the RFID reader or back-end system.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Cover-Coding"><paragraph title="11.6.33." ><![CDATA[<p>Cover-coding is a method of hiding information from eavesdroppers. In the EPCglobal Class-1 Generation-2 standard, cover-coding is used to obscure passwords and information written to a tag using the write command. Some proprietary technologies also support similar features. Cover-coding is an example of minimalist cryptography because it operates within the challenging power and memory constraints of passive RFID tags.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="11.6.34." ><![CDATA[<p>Cover-coding is a useful mitigation where eavesdropping is a risk, but adversaries are expected to be at a greater distance from the tags than readers. Cover-coding helps prevent the execution of unauthorised commands that could disable a tag or modify the tag’s data. Cover-coding mitigates business process, business intelligence, and privacy risks.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Rolling Code"><paragraph title="11.6.35." ><![CDATA[<p>A rolling code approach is a scheme where the identifier given by the RFID tag changes after each read action. It requires the RFID reader and RFID tag to use identical algorithms. If multiple readers are used, they must be linked so that tracking of code changes can be monitored. This scheme reduces the usefulness of any responses that may be observed unless the pattern of change can be detected or deduced.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
</subsection>
<subsection title="Other Defensive Measures"><paragraph title="11.6.36" ><![CDATA[<p><span>Other defensive measures, sometimes described as palliative techniques, include shielding, blocker tags, tag “kill” commands, tamper resistance and temporary deactivation. It is important to note these techniques do not use encryption.</span></p>]]></paragraph>
 <block title="Shielding"><paragraph title="11.6.37." ><![CDATA[<p>RF shielding is designed to limit the propagation of RF signals outside of the shielded area. Shielding helps to prevent unauthorised reading, access to or modification of the RFID tag data or interfering with RFID readers. Shielding can be applied to small, individual items, such as passports and credit cards or to large elements such as shipping containers.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="11.6.38." ><![CDATA[<p>Shielding is also important where interference is present or detected. This may be caused by environmental conditions, such as operating in a port area, or by deliberate attempts to access readers or tags.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="11.6.39." ><![CDATA[<p>Engineering assessments will determine the requirement for shielding from adverse environmental conditions and the risk assessment will determine the likelihood and threat from unauthorised and deliberate attempts to access readers, tags and data.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="11.6.40." ><![CDATA[<p>RFID blocking wallets and<strong> RFID card sleeves</strong> are available to block RFID frequencies. These are typically used for credit and other payment, access and transit cards and e-passports, as a countermeasure for skimming attacks or unauthorised tracking.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Blocker Tags"><paragraph title="11.6.41." ><![CDATA[<p>A special tag, called a “blocker” tag, blocks an RFID reader by simultaneously answering with 0 and 1 to every reader’s request during the identification protocol. The reader is then incapable of distinguishing individual tags. The blocker tag may block a reader universally or within ranges.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="11.6.42." ><![CDATA[<p>This furnishes privacy by shielding consumers from the unwanted scanning of RFID tags that they may carry or wear. It also protects against unauthorised readers and eavesdroppers. The blocker tag is an alternative to more simple solutions such as the kill command, shielding and active jamming. It is important to note that active jamming may be illegal (<a href="http://nzism.gcsb.govt.nz/ism-document#Paragraph-14239">see 11.6.53</a>).</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="11.6.43." ><![CDATA[<p>Blocker tags can also implement one or more privacy policies and multiple blocker tags may cover multiple zones.  The blocker tag has a very low-cost of implementation and standard tags need no modification and little support for password-protected bit flipping.  A threat is that blocker tags can be used to mount DoS attacks in which a malicious blocker tag universally blocks readers.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Tag “Kill” Command "><paragraph title="11.6.44." ><![CDATA[<p>The “kill” command is a password-protected command specified in the EPC Gen-1 and EPC Gen-2 standards intended to make a tag non-operational. A typical application is anti-theft where the kill command is activated at a point-of-sale terminal, after goods have been paid for. Kill commands can be password protected.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="11.6.45." ><![CDATA[<p>Kill commands function by fusing a ROM component or antenna connection by applying a large amount of power to the tag at the point of sale reader/terminal. It is important to note that the antenna deactivation method does not completely kill the tag but rather disable its RF interface. Once in the disabled state, the tag still retains data and can still function.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="11.6.46." ><![CDATA[<p>The kill feature can represent a threat to an RFID system if the password is compromised. This risk is particularly apparent where the same password is used for multiple tags. If a weak (e.g., short or easily guessed) password is assigned to the kill command, tags can be disabled at will. Also important is the longer a tag uses the same password, the more likely it is that the password will be compromised.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="11.6.47." ><![CDATA[<p>Data stored on the tag is still present in the tag’s memory after it is disabled (although it can no longer be accessed wirelessly), and, therefore, still may be accessible with physical access to the tag.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Tamper Resistance"><paragraph title="11.6.48." ><![CDATA[<p>Some RFID tags are designed with tamper resistant or tamper-evident features to help prevent unauthorised alteration of removal of tags from the objects to which they are attached. A simple type of tamper resistance is the use of a frangible, or easily broken, antenna. If this tag is removed, the connection with the antenna is severed, rendering the tag inoperable. Other, more complex types of RFID systems monitor the integrity of objects associated with the tags to ensure that the objects have not been compromised, altered, or subjected to extreme conditions.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="11.6.49." ><![CDATA[<p>Simple forms of tamper resistance may leave data intact and subject to the same threats described above. In addition it is possible to circumvent tamper resistance mechanisms by repairing a frangible antenna. It is important to note that tamper-resistance and tamper-evidence technologies do not prevent the theft or destruction of the tag or its associated items.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Temporary Deactivation"><paragraph title="11.6.50." ><![CDATA[<p>Some tags allow the RF interface to be temporarily deactivated.  Methods vary amongst manufacturers with some methods requiring physical intervention.  Typically tags would be activated inside a designated area and deactivated when shipped, preventing eavesdropping or other unauthorised transactions during shipment.  When the tags arrive at their destination, they can be reactivated, for example for inventory management.  Conversely, tags can be used for tracking during shipment and may be deactivated on delivery.</p>]]></paragraph>

<subsection title="Rationale &amp; Controls"> <block title="Risk Assessment"><paragraph title="11.6.59.R.01." ><![CDATA[<p>As with many technologies, adoption of RFID has the potential to introduce a wide range of risks in addition to the risks that already exist for agency systems. This may include privacy risks, depending on the use, information held and implementation of the RFID system. A risk assessment is an essential tool in determining and assessing the range and extent of risk and threat in the use of RFID devices.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="11.6.59.R.02." ><![CDATA[<p>Risks to RFID system vary according to the technology used, system engineering, the systems architecture, application, context and deployment scenario. A holistic approach to risk at each stage of the system life cycle and each for system component is essential if a robust security strategy is to be developed.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="11.6.59.R.03." ><![CDATA[<p>The identification of classes of tags is fundamental to managing the risks of RFID devices in secure spaces. Classes 0 and 1 pose little risk. Other classes of tag (2 to 5), however, have limited data storage capability and active tags include transmitter functionality which introduces higher levels of risk. RFID readers are, by definition, transmitters and are not permitted in secure spaces.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="11.6.59.C.01." classification="All Classifications" compliance="Must" cid="2956"><![CDATA[<p>Agencies MUST conduct and document a risk assessment <em>before</em> implementing or adopting an RFID solution.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="11.6.59.C.02." classification="All Classifications" compliance="Must" cid="2957"><![CDATA[<p>This risk assessment MUST be the basis of a security architecture design.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Security Architecture"><paragraph title="11.6.60.R.01." ><![CDATA[<p>The foundation of strong security architecture in RFID follows three important principles:</p><ul>
<li><strong>Controlled access to the data</strong> – only authorised entities (people, systems, devices) can read and write information to and from the RFID tags (EPC number, tag identifier, kill password, access password and user memory) and RFID databases;</li>
<li><strong>Control over access to the system</strong> – only authorised entities can configure or add devices to the system, and all devices on the system are authentic and trustworthy;</li>
<li><strong>Confidence and trust</strong> – back-end systems are designed and implemented in accordance with the current version of the NZISM.</li>
</ul>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="11.6.60.R.02." ><![CDATA[<p>Sensitive data should be held in a secure RFID Enterprise Subsystem and retrieved using the tag’s unique identifier with only an identifier stored on the tag itself. The Enterprise RFID subsystem should be established as a separate domain where data can be more adequately protected. This structure makes it more difficult for adversaries to obtain information from the tag through scanning or eavesdropping. Data encryption and access control is often more cost-effectively performed in the enterprise subsystem than in the RF subsystem.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="11.6.60.R.03." ><![CDATA[<p>Some RFID systems may cover several organisations, for example in supply chains. In such cases, multiple organisations may require access to databases that contain tag identifiers and passwords. The security architecture should incorporate strong security controls including the authentication of external entities, incident management, audit logging and other essential security controls.</p>]]></paragraph>

</block>
<block title="Policy"><paragraph title="11.6.61.R.01." ><![CDATA[<p>An RFID Usage Policy is an essential component of an agency’s privacy policy, addressing topics such as how personal information is stored and shared. The RFID usage policy should also address privacy issues associated with the tag identifier formats and the potential disclosure of information based solely on the tag identifier format selected. Agencies MAY be required to ensure that devices that collect and store data comply with relevant regulation and guidance, such as the Privacy Act.

<block title="Inspections "><paragraph title="11.6.62.R.01." ><![CDATA[<p>Many system component manufacturers use RFID tags to track shipments. RFID tags may be embedded in the packaging, printed on the reverse of labels, attached to or embedded in the device itself. The ability to identify and track devices may pose a security concern for secure areas or equipment deployed in high security applications.</p>]]></paragraph>

</block>
<block title="Shielding"><paragraph title="11.6.63.R.01." ><![CDATA[<p>RF shielding is designed to limit the propagation of RF signals outside of the shielded area. Shielding helps to prevent unauthorised reading, access to or modification of the RFID tag data or interfering with RFID readers. Shielding can be applied to small, individual items, such as passports and credit cards or to large elements such as shipping containers. The requirement for shielding is determined by the risk assessment and an engineering assessment.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="11.6.63.C.01." classification="All Classifications" compliance="Should" cid="2978"><![CDATA[<p>Agencies SHOULD consider undertaking an RF engineering assessment where security concerns exist or where the RFID systems are to be used in areas with high levels of RF activity.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="11.6.63.C.02." classification="All Classifications" compliance="Should" cid="2979"><![CDATA[<p>Shielding SHOULD be considered where eavesdropping or RF radiation is a concern, as determined by the risk assessment.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Positioning of Tags and Readers "><paragraph title="11.6.64.R.01." ><![CDATA[<p>In order to minimise unnecessary electromagnetic radiation tags and readers should be carefully positioned. Care should be taken in use of RFID readers in proximity to:</p><ul>
<li>Fuel, ordnance, and other hazardous materials, </li>
<li>Humans and sensitive products (e.g., blood, medicine) that may be harmed by sustained exposure to RF radiation, </li>
<li>Metal and reflective objects that can modify and amplify signals in unintended and potentially harmful ways, and </li>
<li>Legitimate radio and Wi-Fi systems to avoid interference.</li>
</ul>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="11.6.64.R.02." ><![CDATA[<p>Tag location cannot always be controlled, such as when tags are used to track mobile items or goods in transit. Other difficulties occur with persistent radio interference. In these situations, relocation of readers and tags may provide a solution. Consideration should be given to alternative but cost-effective RF protection measures, such as grounded wire fencing. The engineering assessment undertaken to determine the shielding requirements will assist in determining such measures.</p>]]></paragraph>

<block title="Encoding and Encryption"><paragraph title="11.6.65.R.01." ><![CDATA[<p>If an adversary reads an identifier that is encoded with a published format, such as in the EPC standard, an adversary may be able to obtain useful information such as the manufacturer or issuer of the item, as well as the type of item. Because RFID tags hold limited information and identifier formats are published in standards, it may be important to use identifier formats that do not reveal any information about tagged items or the agency using the RFID system. This will be determined in the risk assessment. Encoding schemes to limit information revealed from unauthorised scanning may include serially or randomly assigning identifiers.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="11.6.65.R.02." ><![CDATA[<p>Adversaries can often obtain valuable information from the identifier alone. For example, knowledge of the EPC manager ID and object class bits may reveal the make and model of tagged objects in a container. If individual items or boxes of items are tagged, the quantities may also be discernible. An adversary might target containers based on their contents.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="11.6.65.R.03." ><![CDATA[<p>The smallest tags generally used for consumer items, such as clothing, do not have enough computing power to support data encryption. At best these tags can cater for PIN-style or password-based protection. Data can, however, be encrypted before it is stored on a tag. In these designs, encryption is undertaken by the RFID subsystem or the RFID reader. This is an effective means of protecting the data on a tag. Refer also to <a title="Cryptography" href="http://nzism.gcsb.govt.nz/ism-document#Chapter-15745">Chapter 17 – Cryptography</a>.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="11.6.65.R.04." ><![CDATA[<p>The current Gen 2 standard provides for an on-chip 16-bit Pseudo-Random Number Generator (RNG) and a 16-bit Cyclic Redundancy Code (CRC-16) to protect tag/reader channels. Neither of these encryption methods is strong because of the short bit length in the RNG and because CRCs are not suitable for protection against malicious alteration of data.</p>]]></paragraph>

<block title="Authentication"><paragraph title="11.6.66.R.01." ><![CDATA[<p>Both an RFID reader and RFID tag share a common secret key that can be used in combination with a hash algorithm to provide one-way or mutual authentication between tag and reader. This is known as a<strong> Keyed-Hash Message Authentication Code (HMAC)</strong>. When HMAC is applied to messages, it also assures the integrity of data in the messages. HMAC is not specified in any RFID standard, but the capability is generally available in vendor products. HMAC is often used where the risk of eavesdropping is high and passwords alone are considered to offer an inadequate authentication mechanism. This will be determined by the risk assessment. HMAC is also used where applications require evidence of a tag’s authenticity.</p>]]></paragraph>

</block>
<block title="Password Management"><paragraph title="11.6.67.R.01." ><![CDATA[<p>RFID tags generally require passwords before execution of commands such as reading and writing of tag data, memory access control, and the tag kill feature. Passwords are an important control in maintaining the security and integrity of the RFID system. Refer also to <a title="Access control and passwords" href="http://nzism.gcsb.govt.nz/ism-document#Chapter-15348">Chapter 16 – Access Control and passwords</a>.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="11.6.67.R.02." ><![CDATA[<p>Tags should not share passwords, although this may not be practical in all cases. In applications such as supply chains, multiple organisations may require access to databases that contain tag identifiers and passwords. In such cases external entities must be authenticated and incident management, audit logging and other security controls are essential. While in traditional IT systems, passwords are often changed on a periodic basis, in RFID systems, such changes may be impractical, especially if the tags are not always accessible to the agency assigning the passwords.</p>]]></paragraph>

<block title="Temporary Deactivation of Tags"><paragraph title="11.6.68.R.01." ><![CDATA[<p>The RF interface on some tags can be temporarily deactivated. In a supply chain application, for example, tags may be turned off to prevent unauthorised access to the tags during shipment. This feature is useful when communication between readers and a tag is infrequent allowing the tag to be activated when required but limiting vulnerability to rogue transactions if left operational for extended periods with no authorised activity. Temporary deactivation can also extend battery life in powered tags.</p>]]></paragraph>

<block title="Disposal"><paragraph title="11.6.70.R.01." ><![CDATA[<p>Tag disposal and recycling procedures that permanently disable or destroy sensitive data reduces the possibility that they could be used later for tracking or targeting, and prevents access to sensitive data stored on tags. In addition the continued operating presence of a tag after it has performed its intended function can pose a business intelligence or privacy risk, including tracking, targeting or access to sensitive data on the tag.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="11.6.70.R.02." ><![CDATA[<p>Disposal may be undertaken electronically by using a tag’s “kill” feature or using a strong electromagnetic field to permanently deactivate a tag’s circuitry. Alternatively physical destruction can be achieved by tearing or shredding. Where a tag supports an electronic deactivation mechanism, tags should be electronically deactivated before physical destruction.</p>]]></paragraph>

<section title="11.7. Card Access Control Systems"><subsection title="Objective"><paragraph title="11.7.1." ><![CDATA[<p>To ensure Access Control Systems incorporating contactless RFID or smart cards are used safely and securely in order to protect privacy, prevent unauthorised access and to prevent the compromise of secure spaces.</p>]]></paragraph>
 </subsection>
<subsection title="Context"> <block title="Scope "><paragraph title="11.7.2." ><![CDATA[<p>This section provides information relating to the risks, security and secure use of RFID or smart cards in access control systems. This section does not discuss biometric access control systems.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="11.7.3." ><![CDATA[<p>The previous section (<a title="RFIDs" href="http://nzism.gcsb.govt.nz/ism-document#Section-14166">11.6. Radio Frequency Identification Devices</a>) provides background information and technical detail of the RFID aspects and should be read in conjunction with this section.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Background"><paragraph title="11.7.4." ><![CDATA[<p>Contactless access control systems based on RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) has largely replaced earlier technologies such as magnetic swipe cards in almost all security-critical applications. Two generations of RFID access cards exist:</p><ul>
<li>an earlier generation of cards, which use only basic proprietary security mechanisms; and </li>
<li>a more recent generation that incorporates advances in CMOS and smart card technology to implement cryptography and other protective measures.</li>
</ul>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="11.7.5." ><![CDATA[<p>Older access control systems often incorporated a magnetic strip and were easily cloned. More recent systems support the use of PINs in addition to RFID. Unfortunately PINs are also sometimes stored on the cards, often unencrypted and unprotected, and thus facilitating attacks on both the card and the PIN.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="11.7.6." ><![CDATA[<p>Access control systems typically comprise four components:</p><ul>
<li>A reader that programmes the access cards for particular employees and their permitted access to parts of the site, building to secure areas.</li>
<li>A transceiver at each control point to communicate with cards.</li>
<li>A controller to control the locks of access points (doors).</li>
<li>The backend system that hosts all permissions and authorised data and interfaces with the reader, transceiver and controllers.</li>
</ul>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="11.7.7." ><![CDATA[<p>Traditionally access control systems were hosted by stand-alone equipment. Modern access control system may be hosted on standard computer equipment and hosted in the organisation’s datacentre. It is possible that a system intrusion can target access control systems, making the switches, gates and locks remotely accessible.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="11.7.8." ><![CDATA[<p>Low frequency RFID badge systems use 125KHz, (ISO 11784/5 and ISO 14223). Newer high frequency RFID cards use 13.56MHz (ISO 15693, ISO 14443 and ISO 18000-3).</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="11.7.9." ><![CDATA[<p>Some cards also operate at UHF frequencies of 850-960Mhz (ISO 18000-6). Some cards are designed to operate at low and high frequencies by embedding multiple antennae in the cards.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="11.7.10." ><![CDATA[<p>The <a title="ISO/IEC 14443" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.iso.org/search.html?q=14443" target="_blank">ISO/IEC 14443</a> standard for contactless smart card communications defines two types of contactless cards ("A" and "B") and allows for communications at distances up to 10 cm operating at 13.56 MHz.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="11.7.11." ><![CDATA[<p>The alternative <a title="ISO/IEC 15693" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.iso.org/search.html?q=15693" target="_blank">ISO/IEC 15693</a> standard allows communications at distances up to 50 cm.

<paragraph title="11.7.12." ><![CDATA[<p>UHF cards follow the <a title="EPC Global Gen2" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.gs1.org/sites/default/files/docs/epc/uhfc1g2_2_0_0_standard_20131101.pdf" target="_blank">EPC Global Gen2</a> standard and the <a title="ISO/IEC 18000-6" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.iso.org/search.html?q=18000-6" target="_blank">ISO 18000-6</a> standards and are designed to operate at distances of up to 10 metres.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Smart Cards"><paragraph title="11.7.13." ><![CDATA[<p>Smart cards typically incorporate an embedded integrated circuit typically incorporating a microchip with internal memory, a read-only CSN (Card Serial Number) or a UID (User Identification). The card connects to a reader with direct physical contact or a contactless radio frequency (RFID) interface. With an embedded microchip, smart cards can store large amounts of data, carry out on-card functions (such as encryption and authentication) and interact intelligently with a smart card reader. Smart card technology can be found in a variety of form factors, including plastic cards, key fobs, watches, subscriber identification modules used in mobile phones, and USB-based tokens. Smart cards are widely used in payment card (debit and credit cards and electronic wallets) and access control systems.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="11.7.14." ><![CDATA[<p>In common with other RFID devices, smart cards incorporate an antenna embedded in the body of the card (or key fob, watch or token). When the card is brought within range of the reader, the chip in the card is powered on. Once powered on, an RF communication protocol is initiated and communication established between the card and the reader for data transfer.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="11.7.15." ><![CDATA[<p>Smart cards typically incorporate protective mechanisms including authentication, secure data storage, encryption, tamper-resistance and secure communication. Support for biometric authentication may also be incorporated.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Near Field Communication (NFC)"><paragraph title="11.7.16." ><![CDATA[<p>NFC is an RFID technology that enables two electronic devices to establish communication by bringing them within 4 cm of each other. As with other "proximity" technologies, NFC employs electromagnetic induction between two loop antennae when NFC devices exchange information. NFC operates in the globally available unlicensed radio frequency band of 13.56 MHz conforming to the ISO/IEC 18000-3 standard. In access control applications these devices are sometimes known as “prox cards”.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Attacks"><paragraph title="11.7.17." ><![CDATA[<p>In addition to attacks on RFID components described in the previous section, access control cards can be susceptible to relay and chip hacking attacks.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="11.7.18." ><![CDATA[<p>Relay attacks rely on rogue readers to activate the tag even when not in proximity to a legitimate reader. The card holder will be unaware that such an attack is underway. An effective defence is to incorporate distance-to-reader verification although few RFID systems incorporate this mechanism.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="11.7.19." ><![CDATA[<p>Signals between cards and a legitimate reader can be intercepted at distances of up to a metre. Greater distances are possible with higher powered equipment, special antennae and in low interference environments. The signals and data, including card credentials, are captured off-line and used to clone access cards. Again the card holder will be unaware that such an attack is underway.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="11.7.20." ><![CDATA[<p>Chip hacking is facilitated by physical access to the card but can be mitigated by second factor authentication, encryption of data on the card and card tamper detection.</p>]]></paragraph>

<paragraph title="11.7.24." ><![CDATA[<p>Physically a SAM card can either be a separate component and plugged into a device when required or incorporated into an integrated circuit. A typically use is for the secure storage of cryptographic keys or other sensitive data. SAM hardware and software are designed to prevent information leakage and incorporates countermeasures against electromagnetic radiation, timing measurements, and other side channel attacks. These properties mean that SAMs offer a much higher level of protection than the terminals and readers, which often utilise general-purpose computers.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="11.7.25." ><![CDATA[<p>SAM’s typically support 3DES and AES cryptographic algorithms and SHA hashing algorithms in their hardware cryptographic co-processor implementations. Refer to Chapter 17 for information on approved cryptographic algorithms and protocols.

This may compromise the cards and enable unauthorised access, in addition to RFID risks discussed in the previous section. A risk assessment is an essential tool in determining and assessing the range and extent of risk and threat in the use of RFID access cards.</p>]]></paragraph>

<block title="Security Architecture"><paragraph title="11.7.30.R.01." ><![CDATA[<p>The foundation of strong security architecture in RFID follows these important principles:</p><ol>
<li><strong>Physical Security</strong> - over readers, secure areas, issued and unissued access cards;</li>
<li><strong>Controlled access to the data</strong> – only authorised entities (people, systems, devices) can read and write information to the cards, card databases and backend systems;</li>
<li><strong>Control over access to the system</strong> – only authorised entities can configure or add devices to the system, and all devices on the system are authentic and trustworthy;</li>
<li><strong>Confidence and trust</strong> – back-end systems are designed and implemented in accordance with the current version of the NZISM. This includes intrusion detection and incident management mechanisms and procedures.</li>
</ol>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="11.7.30.R.02." ><![CDATA[<p>Some access systems may cover several organisations or sites. In such cases, multiple organisations or sites may require access to databases that contain personnel identifiers, passwords and access permissions.

Product Selection and Acquisition"><subsection title="Objective"><paragraph title="12.1.1." ><![CDATA[<p>Products providing security functions for the protection of classified information are formally evaluated in order to provide a degree of assurance over the integrity and performance of the product.</p>]]></paragraph>
 </subsection>
<subsection title="Context"> <block title="Scope"><paragraph title="12.1.2." ><![CDATA[<p>This section covers information on the selection and acquisition of any product that provide security functionality for the protection of information. It DOES NOT provide information on the selection or acquisition of products that do not provide security functionality or physical security products.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Selecting products without security functions"><paragraph title="12.1.3." ><![CDATA[<p>Agencies selecting products that do not provide a security function or selecting products that will not use their security functions are free to follow their own agency or departmental acquisition guidelines.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Product specific requirements"><paragraph title="12.1.4." ><![CDATA[<p>Where consumer guides exist for evaluated products, agencies should identify and assess any potential conflicts with this manual. Where further advice is required, consult the GCSB.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Convergence"><paragraph title="12.1.5." ><![CDATA[<p>Convergence is the integration of a number of discrete technologies into one product. Converged solutions can include the advantages and disadvantages of each discrete technology.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="12.1.6." ><![CDATA[<p>Most products will exhibit some element of convergence. When products have converged elements, agencies will need to comply with the relevant areas of this manual for the discrete technologies when deploying the converged product.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="12.1.7." ><![CDATA[<p>As an example, when agencies choose to use evaluated media, such as encrypted flash memory media, the requirements for evaluated products, media and cryptographic security apply.</p>]]></paragraph>

<subsection title="Assurance"><paragraph title="12.1.8." ><![CDATA[<p>In Common Criteria (CC), assurance is the confidence that a Target of Evaluation (TOE) meets the Security Functional Requirements (SFR) of the product.</p>]]></paragraph>
 <block title="Determining Assurance"><paragraph title="12.1.9." ><![CDATA[<p>In order to determine the level of assurance (the EAL), the CC standard requires tests, checks and evaluations in several areas. Higher levels of assurance require more extensive design, documentation, testing and evaluation. Determining assurance requires assessment of the following elements:</p><ul>
<li>Development;</li>
<li>Guidance documents;</li>
<li>Life-cycle support;</li>
<li>Security Target evaluation;</li>
<li>Tests; and</li>
<li>Vulnerability assessment.</li>
</ul>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Augmented Assurance"><paragraph title="12.1.10." ><![CDATA[<p>It is possible to “augment” an evaluation to provide additional assurance without changing the fundamental assurance level. This mechanism allows the addition of assurance components not specifically required for a specific level of evaluation or the substitution of assurance components from the specification of another hierarchically higher assurance component. Of the assurance constructs defined in the CC, only EALs may be augmented. An augmented EAL is often indicated by a ”+”-sign (for example EAL4+). The concept of negative augmentation or an “EAL minus” is not recognised by the standard.</p>]]></paragraph>

<block title="Recognition arrangements"><paragraph title="12.1.16." ><![CDATA[<p>The AISEP programme has a number of recognition arrangements regarding evaluated products. Before choosing a product that has not been evaluated by the AISEP, agencies are encouraged to contact the GCSB to enquire whether the product will be recognised for New Zealand use once it has complete evaluation in a foreign scheme.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="12.1.17." ><![CDATA[<p>Two such recognition arrangements are for the Common Criteria Recognition Arrangement up to the assurance level of EAL2 with the lifecycle flaw remediation augmentation and for degausser products listed on the National Security Agency/Central Security Service’s EPLD.</p>]]></paragraph>

<li>evaluation and certification of products using the Common Criteria;</li>
<li>continued maintenance of the assurance of evaluated products; and</li>
<li>recognition of products evaluated by a foreign scheme with which the AISEP has a mutual recognition agreement (generally the <a title="CCRA" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.commoncriteriaportal.org/ccra/" target="_blank">Common Criteria Recognition Agreement – CCRA</a>).</li>
</ul>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Protection Profiles"><paragraph title="12.1.20." ><![CDATA[<p>A Protection Profile (PP) describes the security functionality that must be included in a Common Criteria evaluation to meet a range of defined threats. PPs also define the activities to be taken to assess the security functions of a product. Agencies can have confidence that a product evaluated against an AISEP or GCSB approved PP addresses the defined threats. Approved PPs are published on the <a title="CPL" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://commoncriteriaportal.org/products/" target="_blank">Certified Products List</a>.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="12.1.21." ><![CDATA[<p>The introduction of PP’s is to reduce the time required for evaluation, compared with the traditional approach to allow the AISEP to keep pace with the rapid evolution, production and release of security products and updates.  Cryptographic security functionality is included in the scope of evaluation against an approved Protection Profile. </p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="12.1.22." ><![CDATA[<p>To facilitate the transition to AISEP approved Protection Profiles, a cap of Evaluation Assurance Level (EAL) 2 applies for all traditional AISEP (EAL based evaluations), including for technologies with no existing approved Protection Profile. EAL 2 is considered to represent a sensible trade-off between completion time and meaningful security assurance gains.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="12.1.23." ><![CDATA[<p>Evaluations conducted in other nations’ Common Criteria schemes will continue to be recognised by the GCSB under the AISEP.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="12.1.24." ><![CDATA[<p>Some High Assurance evaluations continue to be conducted in European Approved Testing Facilities and use the EAL rating scheme. ASD run an independent High Assurance Evaluation scheme which is not related to AISEP or an EAL rating.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="12.1.25." ><![CDATA[<p>It is important that Agencies check the evaluation has examined the security enforcing functions by reviewing the target of evaluation/security target and other testing documentation.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="12.1.26." ><![CDATA[<p>The UK utilises several product evaluation schemes such as the CESG Assisted Products Service (CAPS), CESG Assured Service (CAS) and IT Security Evaluation Criteria (ITSEC).

 </subsection>
<subsection title="Context"> <block title="Scope"><paragraph title="12.7.2." ><![CDATA[<p>The NZISM provides additional guidance for managing supply chain security risks associated with the acquisition (lease or purchase) of ICT equipment or services for use in NZ Government systems.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Supply chain"><paragraph title="12.7.3." ><![CDATA[<p><span>A supply chain is the movement of materials as they move from their source (raw materials) through manufacture to the end customer. A supply chain can include materials acquisition, purchasing, design, manufacturing, warehousing, transportation, customer service, and supply chain management. It requires people, information and resources to move a product from manufacturer to supplier to customer. Every supply chain carries some risk which may include product protection; counterfeit products and goods and defective products. ICT supply chains are invariably global and complex.</span></p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="12.7.4." ><![CDATA[<p>Relationships with external service providers are established in a variety of ways, for example, through joint ventures, business partnerships, outsourcing arrangements (e.g. through supply contracts, interagency agreements, lines of business arrangements, service-level agreements), licensing agreements, and/or supply chain exchanges. The growing use of external service providers and new relationships being established with those providers present new and difficult challenges for organisations, especially in the area of information system security. These challenges include:</p><ul>
<li>Defining the types of external information system services provided to organisations;</li>
<li>Describing how those external services are protected; and</li>
<li>Obtaining the necessary assurances that the risks to organisational operations and assets, individuals, other organisations, and national security arising from the use of the external services are acceptable.</li>
</ul>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Supply chain risk"><paragraph title="12.7.5." ><![CDATA[<p><span>The degree of confidence that the risk from using external services is at an acceptable level depends on the assurance external organisations provide and trust that organisations place in external service providers. In some cases, the level of trust is based on the amount of direct control organisations are able to exert on external service providers in the use of security controls and assurance on the effectiveness of those controls.</span></p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="12.7.6." ><![CDATA[<p><span>The level of control is usually established by the terms and conditions of the contracts or service-level agreements with the external service providers and can range from extensive control (e.g., negotiating contracts or agreements that specify detailed security requirements for the providers) to very limited control (e.g., using contracts or service-level agreements to obtain commodity services such as commercial telecommunications services).</span></p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="12.7.7." ><![CDATA[<p>From an Information Assurance viewpoint, there are five key aspects to supply chain risk:</p><ol>
<li>Protection of sensitive information and systems;</li>
<li>Continuity of supply;&nbsp;</li>
<li>Product assurance;</li>
<li>Security validation; and</li>
<li>National Procurement Policy</li>
</ol>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Protection of sensitive information and systems"><paragraph title="12.7.8." ><![CDATA[<p>This relates to the security of the supply chain, products and information relating to the intended use, purchaser, location and type of equipment.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Continuity of supply"><paragraph title="12.7.9." ><![CDATA[<p>This is the traditional set of risks associated with supply chain. As supply chains have globalised and components are sourced from a number of countries, a disruption to supply may have a global effect.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Product assurance"><paragraph title="12.7.10." ><![CDATA[<p>This relates to assurance that the product, technology or device performs as designed and specified and includes the provenance of the product, equipment, or device.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Security validation"><paragraph title="12.7.11." ><![CDATA[<p>Security validation checks the performance and security of the equipment. The security design elements and features of the equipment or product will need to be separately considered from any operational drivers.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="National procurement policy"><paragraph title="12.7.12." ><![CDATA[<p>All agencies are required to follow the guidance of the Government Rules of Procurement. Some exemptions are permitted under Rule 13 including that of security, “essential security interests: Measures necessary for the protection of essential security interests, procurement indispensable for national security or for national defence…”. Care must be taken to follow these rules wherever possible.</p>]]></paragraph>

System Decommissioning"><subsection title="Objective"><paragraph title="13.1.1." ><![CDATA[<p>To ensure systems are safely decommissioned and that software, system logic and data are properly transitioned to new systems or archived in accordance with agency, legal and statutory requirements.</p>]]></paragraph>
 </subsection>
<subsection title="Context"> <block title="Scope"><paragraph title="13.1.2." ><![CDATA[<p>This section discusses the retirement and safe decommissioning of systems. Specific requirements on media handling, usage, sanitisation, destruction and disposal are discussed later in this chapter. System decommissioning is the retirement or termination of a system and its operations. System decommissioning does NOT deal with the theft or loss of equipment.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Definitions"><paragraph title="13.1.3." ><![CDATA[<p>A system decommissioning will have one or more of the following characteristics:</p><ul>
<li>Ending a capability completely i.e. no migration, redevelopment or new version of a capability occurs;</li>
<li>Combining parts of existing capabilities services into a new, different system;</li>
<li>As part of wider redesign, where a capability is no longer provided and is decommissioned or merged with other capabilities or systems.</li>
</ul>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="13.1.4." ><![CDATA[<p>ICT requirements evolve as business needs change and technology advances. In some cases this will lead to the retirement and decommissioning of obsolete systems or systems surplus to requirements.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="13.1.5." ><![CDATA[<p>Security requires a structured approach to decommissioning in order to cease information system operations in a planned, orderly and secure manner. It is also important that the approach for decommissioning systems is consistent and coordinated. Sanitisation is important to eliminate any remnant data that could be retrieved by unauthorised parties. These procedures include the following:</p><ul>
<li>A migration plan;</li>
<li>A decommissioning plan;</li>
<li>Archiving;</li>
<li>Safe disposal of equipment and media;</li>
<li>Robust procedures to manage any residual data and associated risk; and</li>
<li>Audit and final signoff.</li>

Decommissioning of a system will require the termination of these contracts and service obligations. Other aspects of system decommission may be subject to security, regulatory or legislative requirements. An Agency policy will provide a comprehensive approach to system decommissioning from the inception of a system, thus facilitating the termination of supply contracts and service obligations while managing any risks to the Agency.</p>]]></paragraph>

<block title="Definition"><paragraph title="13.4.3." ><![CDATA[<p>Sanitisation is defined as the process of removal of data and information from the storage device such that data recovery using any known technique or analysis is prevented or made unfeasible. The process includes the removal of all useful data from the storage device, including metadata, as well as the removal of all labels, markings, classifications and activity logs. Methods vary depending upon the nature, technology used and construction of the storage device or equipment and may include degaussing, incineration, shredding, grinding, knurling or embossing and chemical immersion.</p>]]></paragraph>

<block title="Non-volatile magnetic media sanitisation"><paragraph title="13.4.13.R.01." ><![CDATA[<p>The following guidance applies in cases where media is to be redeployed. </p><p>Both the host protected area and device configuration overlay table of non-volatile magnetic hard disks are normally not visible to the operating system or the computer’s BIOS. Hence any sanitisation of the readable sectors on the media will not overwrite these hidden sectors leaving any classified information contained in these locations untouched. Some sanitisation programs include the ability to reset devices to their default state removing any host protected areas or device configuration overlays. This allows the sanitisation program to see the entire contents of the media during the subsequent sanitisation process.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="13.4.13.R.02." ><![CDATA[<p>Modern non-volatile magnetic hard disks automatically reallocate space for bad sectors at a hardware level. These bad sectors are maintained in what is known as the growth defects table or ‘g-list’. If classified information was stored in a sector that is subsequently added to the g-list, sanitising the media will not overwrite these non-addressable bad sectors, and remnant data will exist in these locations. Whilst these sectors may be considered bad by the device quite often this is due to the sectors no longer meeting expected performance norms for the device and not due to an inability to read/write to the sector.</p>]]></paragraph>

<subsection title="Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting and Conformance (DMARC)"> <block title="Vocabulary"><paragraph title="15.2.6" ><![CDATA[<p>The terms “none”, “reject” and “quarantine” are used to describe DMARC actions based on policy modes.&nbsp; In this usage:</p>
<ul>
<li>“none” means no action on the transmission or receipt of the email but continue to collect data and send reports;</li>
<li>By default, email under a “reject” policy setting is not delivered.&nbsp; “Reject” either:
<ul>
<li>refuses to accept non-compliant email, or</li>
<li>initially accepts the non-compliant email but prevents an email reaching the user.&nbsp; The acceptance process can generate a Delivery Status Notification (block/“bounce”) or simply delete/drop the email (block/delete);</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>“quarantine” prevents an email from reaching the user but safely storing it so it can be accessed if required (a potentially suspicious email and/or attachment subject to additional scrutiny).&nbsp; Quarantined items can be released following a review and release process.</li>
</ul>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="What is DMARC"><paragraph title="15.2.7." ><![CDATA[<p>Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting and Conformance (DMARC) is an email authentication policy and reporting protocol that:</p>
<ul>
<li>complements and unifies the existing validation checks performed by SPF and DKIM;</li>
<li>checks the stated origin of inbound emails using a combination of <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/email-security-standards/sender-policy-framework-spf" target="_blank">Sender Policy Framework</a> (SPF) and <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/email-security-standards/domainkeys-identified-mail-dkim" target="_blank">DomainKeys Identified Mail</a> (DKIM);</li>
<li>establishes a recipient email response for emails that fail the check;</li>
<li>requests recipient email services to report email sources and origins;</li>
<li>provides visibility over potentially illegitimate or fraudulent email.</li>
</ul>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="15.2.8." ><![CDATA[<p>DMARC builds on SPF and DKIM protocols, adding links to the author (“From:”) domain name, published policies for recipient handling of authentication failures, and reporting from receivers to senders, in order to improve and monitor protection of the recipient domain from fraudulent email.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="15.2.9." ><![CDATA[<p>Most email services will check your DMARC record and send aggregated reports including details of all email the service received from the agency, and its origin.&nbsp; This assists in identifying if an individual within the agency is sending email inappropriately or if the agency domain is being spoofed.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Background, Reference and Implementation Guidance Sources"><paragraph title="15.2.10." ><![CDATA[<p>The IETF published RFC 7489, “Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance (DMARC)” 18 March 2015. This is the principal standards guidance on the implementation and use of DMARC.&nbsp;Further guidance is available from The Global Cyber Alliance (GCA) - see References below.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Using DMARC"><paragraph title="15.2.11." ><![CDATA[<p>The combination of DMARC, SPF, and DKIM records in DNS automates the ability of email service providers to confirm which servers should be legitimately sending email from the agency’s domain, and what action to take with mail received from any other domains.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="15.2.12." ><![CDATA[<p>As a pre-requisite for implementing DMARC, agencies <strong>must</strong> publish an SPF and a DKIM record in DNS. Agencies must also ensure that emails sent by the agency (including from third party services sending on behalf of the agency) have a DKIM signature that matches the signature in the DKIM record.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="15.2.13." ><![CDATA[<p>Agencies can choose to quarantine or reject messages that fail checks.&nbsp; More specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sender Policy Framework (SPF) is used to specify legitimate locations of servers which can send email for your domain;</li>
<li>DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) isn't supported by all mail servers, but if it is, it can be used to cryptographically sign outgoing mail sent by your servers to give email service providers further confidence that it's legitimate;</li>
<li>DMARC is used to inform email service providers what action they should take if SPF or DKIM (or both) validation fails;</li>
<li>One important aspect of DMARC is the action you ask email service providers to take when&nbsp;SPF or DKIM validation fails:
<ul>
<li>a policy of p=none means that they should allow non-compliant emails to be delivered but report the failure to the agency;</li>
<li>a policy of p=quarantine requests that they mark the email as spam;</li>
<li>a policy of p=reject requests the email service provider to refuse to deliver the email.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="15.2.14." ><![CDATA[<p>A text record published in DNS is used to notify other organisations of the use of DMARC. The following demonstrates an example DMARC record:</p>
<ul>
<li>v=DMARC1;</li>
<li>p=quarantine;</li>
<li>rua=mailto:dmarc@agency.govt.nz (where agency is the name of the respective agency).</li>
</ul>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="15.2.15." ><![CDATA[<p>This informs email recipients that:</p>
<ul>
<li>you have a DMARC policy (v=DMARC1)</li>
<li>any messages that fail DMARC checks should be treated as spam (p=quarantine)</li>
<li>they should send reports of email received back to you (rua=mailto:dmarc@agency.govt.nz)</li>
</ul>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="15.2.16." ><![CDATA[<p>It is not unusual to experience minor errors in syntax or other elements of DMARC configuration when first implementing DMARC.&nbsp; Some discussion on common problems, issues and solutions can be found on the DMARC website (see the References table below).</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="15.2.17." ><![CDATA[<p>For domains expected to be used for email, it is not recommended to move directly to a full implementation of DMARC until there is certainty that the configuration and implementation are stable and operating as intended. The following implementation outline is recommended by the GCA and DMARC organisations (<a title="References" href="http://nzism.gcsb.govt.nz/ism-document#SubSection-15279">see 15.2.19 References</a>):</p>
<ol>
<li>Deploy DKIM &amp; SPF;</li>
<li>Ensure mailers are correctly aligning the appropriate identifiers;</li>
<li>Publish a DMARC record with the “none” flag set for the policies, which requests data reports;</li>
<li>Analyse the data and modify mail streams as appropriate; and</li>
<li>Modify DMARC policy flags from “none” to “quarantine” to “reject” as experience dictates.</li>
</ol>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Securing non-email sending domains"><paragraph title="15.2.18." ><![CDATA[<p>Threat actors may attempt to spoof a domain that is not intended to send or receive email. Operators of domains that do not send mail can publish Sender Policy Framework (SPF) "-all" policies to make an explicit declaration that the domains send no mail. The following DNS entries create blank SPF and DKIM entries effectively forcing every email sent (spoofed) from a non-mail-enabled domain to fail all checks, giving the highest possible chance of these emails not reaching their intended destination.</p>
<ul>
<li>SPF&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“v=spf1 -all”</li>
<li>DKIM &nbsp; “v=DKIM1; p=”</li>
<li>DMARC&nbsp; “V=DMARC1;p=reject;sp=reject;adkim-s;aspf=s;rua=mailto:&lt;your dmarc report RUA email address&gt;;”</li>
</ul>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="DMARC Reporting"><paragraph title="15.2.19" ><![CDATA[<p>DMARC reporting provides information to assist an agency’s IT system and email administrators.&nbsp; It can also provide an email asset inventory as well as providing data on spam, phishing and other email exploitation techniques.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="15.2.20." ><![CDATA[<p>DMARC can be configured to produce an aggregate report and a forensic report.&nbsp; In some cases agencies may also send reports to an external organisation such as a DMARC reporting service or a third-party IT service provider.&nbsp; Discretion should be used when providing such information to third parties in order to maintain security and privacy.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
</subsection>
<subsection title="Secure email transport"><paragraph title="15.2.21." ><![CDATA[<p>Over time, several protocols have emerged to support the encryption of email traffic in transit. Secure email transport protects your email from person-in-the middle attacks like eavesdropping, manipulation, and cryptographic downgrade.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="15.2.22." ><![CDATA[<p>With parties that you contact regularly by email (eg, partner organisations), it is possible to configure connections so that TLS will always be used, and the certificates presented by both mail servers are authenticated, verifying the identities of both parties.</p>]]></paragraph>
 <block title="STARTTLS, Opportunistic TLS"><paragraph title="15.2.23." ><![CDATA[<p>Opportunistic TLS is configured on the sending server. STARTTLS (RFC 3207) is a protocol command that upgrades an insecure connection to a secure connection using TLS. Agencies must enable opportunistic TLS encryption.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Using MTA-STS"><paragraph title="15.2.24." ><![CDATA[<p>SMTP MTA Strict Transport Security (MTA-STS) is a standard that adds support for strict encryption without relying on DNSSEC (RFC 8461). With MTA-STS, you can specify that mail traffic sent to a domain is encrypted with a specific public encryption key. Agencies should enable MTA-STS.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="15.2.25." ><![CDATA[<p>The objectives of MTA-STS are to:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>make it harder for an attacker to intercept and redirect emails&nbsp;</li>
<li>make sure that TLS encryption is always used,</li>
<li>prevent attackers downgrading email encryption on emails to cleartext,</li>
<li>provide visibility reports through the TLS reporting protocol.</li>
</ul>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="15.2.26." ><![CDATA[<p>To achieve this, MTA-STS works in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your organisation can advertise the mail server hostname on a separate secure web page, which means an attacker cannot subvert your DNS entry (specifically your MX record, which is the record that indicates how an email should be routed using the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol).<br><br></li>
<li>Your organisation can publish an ‘MTA-STS enforce policy’, which tells any server sending you emails to always send with TLS encryption, and to not allow connections to be downgraded. If there is a failure to establish a secure TLS connection, emails will not be delivered. Note that when your organisation sets up MTA-STS, you are securing inbound connections only.</li>
</ul>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="15.2.27." ><![CDATA[<p>MTA-STS is relatively simple to implement, but organisations must step through their implementation with care; if you switch on controls too quickly then inbound emails may not be delivered. To mitigate this risk, we always recommend using MTA-STS in ‘testing mode’ first, and to set up TLS-RPT (TLS Reporting) as a mechanism for getting feedback before you progress.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="15.2.28." ><![CDATA[<p>The goal ultimately is to work towards implementing an MTA-STS policy of ‘enforce’. When a sending email service detects you have an MTA-STS policy of ‘enforce’, they should only send email to your domain if the connection is secure. Note however, that whilst many major email providers have built support for MTA-STS, there is not yet complete support from all vendors. For those that don’t yet support it, emails will continue to be delivered in all cases.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="15.2.29." ><![CDATA[<p>While they achieve the same aim, DNS-based Authentication of Named Entities (DANE) and MTA-STS do not conflict and can be implemented in parallel. You can implement MTA-STS by deploying signed TLS certificates to a domain’s email and web servers, publishing an MTA-STS policy on the web server, and publishing MTA-STS records in DNS. Like DMARC, MTA-STS supports the delivery of aggregate reporting to system owners.&nbsp;</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="15.2.30." ><![CDATA[<p>MTA-STS (Mail Transfer Agent – Strict Transport Security) is configured on the receiving server, forcing inbound email connections to use TLS if the sending server supports MTA-STS; there is no drop down to cleartext. If the sending server does not support MTA-STS the connection can use opportunistic TLS, or even send in the clear.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="TLS reporting"><paragraph title="15.2.31." ><![CDATA[<p>Organisations should also enable TLS reporting when implementing MTA-STS (RFC 8460). By implementing TLS reporting, organisations will be able to see the performance of its domains, the success or failure rate, and the impact of the organisation’s MTA-STS and policies. This will give organisations important insight into which mail services it needs to configure to ensure no interruption in mail flow.&nbsp;</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Secure cryptography"><paragraph title="15.2.32." ><![CDATA[<p>Historically, network traffic between mail servers was unencrypted, leaving it vulnerable to interception or modification in transit. Although it is possible to encrypt individual emails using protocols like PGP or S/MIME, this requires the sender and recipient to have the necessary trust infrastructure in place. Approved implementation of S/MIME and OpenPGP are discussed in Chapter 17, 17.6 Secure Multipurpose Internet Mail Extension, and 17.7 OpenPGP Message Format.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="15.2.33." ><![CDATA[<p>This is not likely to be possible for all the parties you communicate with. So, your email servers should be configured to support encryption of the communications channel that the email is sent over. This task is best handled by TLS. Agencies should use the current version of TLS, see [CID:2598]. When implementing MTA-STS, agencies should use TLS1.2 or above on email servers.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="15.2.34." ><![CDATA[<p>Implementation details</p>
<ul>
<li>Configure all your email servers to support TLS, regardless of whether they are accessible from the internet or private networks only.</li>
<li>Ensure your email servers present a certificate with suitable cryptographic properties and that it is signed by a trusted Certificate Authority.</li>
<li>Ensure your email servers prefer to use a good cryptographic profile, but that lesser cryptographic profiles are supported too. You should support the case where TLS is not used at all, if you want to be confident you can receive emails from any entity.</li>
<li>Where possible, consider configuring your email service to force TLS between you and organisations you regularly communicate with.</li>
</ul>]]></paragraph>

 </subsection>
<subsection title="Context"> <block title="Scope"><paragraph title="16.1.2." ><![CDATA[<p>This section provides information on the identification and authentication of all system users.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="16.1.3." ><![CDATA[<p>Access Control is any mechanism by which an individual, system or application grants or revokes the right to access some location, system, data, or perform some action.  Access Control must be supported by an appropriate organisational policy.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="16.1.4." ><![CDATA[<p>In this context a user is a real person.  Machine or device to device communication and interaction will also require authentication.  It is important to note, however, that the usual mechanisms applied to real persons cannot always be used in device to device authentication, for example, biometrics cannot be used.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="16.1.5." ><![CDATA[<p>In Information Technology, a user will usually register a person’s identity supported by some evidence of identity (Eol).  This will be accompanied by an authority or approval to access information, usually from a manager or other executive.  The authentication system will then issue credentials, usually user ID and password, but may also include tokens or use biometrics.  The credentials are the means by which a user (a person) accesses an information technology system and are verified each time a user logs onto a system.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="16.1.6." ><![CDATA[<p>Access Control systems manage access rights, including:</p><ul>
<li>Physical access to locations;</li>
<li>File system permissions, including physical documents and files, such as create, read, edit or delete data;</li>
<li>Program permissions, such as the right to execute a programme;</li>
<li>Data rights, such as the right to retrieve, print or update information in a database.</li>
</ul>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Methods for user identification and authentication"><paragraph title="16.1.7." ><![CDATA[<p>Authentication is the process by which a claimed identity is verified and access permissions are confirmed before access is granted.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="16.1.8." ><![CDATA[<p>User authentication can be achieved by various means, including biometrics, cryptographic tokens, software tokens, passphrases, passwords and smartcards.  Where this manual refers to passwords it equally applies to passphrases.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="16.1.9." ><![CDATA[<p>Authentication mechanisms are invariably described in terms of factors of authentication as follows:</p><ol>
<li>Something you have (preferably NOT the device itself but a SEPARATE authentication device such as a token, RFID card or smartcard). This is also known as the <em>possession</em> factor;</li>
<li>Something you know such as a PIN, One-Time Password (OTP), reusable password, pattern or other component of a standard authentication mechanism. This is also described as the <em>knowledge</em> factor;</li>
<li>Something you are (biometrics of various types). This is also described as the <em>inherence</em> factor.</li>
</ol>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="16.1.10." ><![CDATA[<p>Commonly used two factor authentication schemes are combinations of physical presence, a token and a PIN/Password.  Biometrics are less commonly used on mobile or remote systems.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Software Tokens"><paragraph title="16.1.11." ><![CDATA[<p>Software Tokens, Soft Tokens or “softokens” are typically applications that run on mobile devices such as smart phones, tablets, laptops other workstations. They are sometimes also known as “virtual tokens”. When soft tokens are used the device itself then becomes the “possession factor”. Functionality may include:</p><ul>
<li>Transfer between devices by the user.</li>
<li>Use of Quick Response (QR) codes to facilitate deployment.</li>
<li>Manages international time zones changes when travelling.</li>
</ul>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="16.1.12." ><![CDATA[<p>The soft token (secret) is vulnerable to any attacker that can gain full access to the device through theft, loss or download of malware.  This is not as secure as a <em>separate</em> hardware token which is more resistant to attack and tampering.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Passwords and Password storage"><paragraph title="16.1.13." ><![CDATA[<p>Password length and composition (character type) has been found to be a primary factor in characterizing password strength [Strength][Composition]. Passwords that are too short yield to brute force attacks as well as to dictionary attacks using words and commonly chosen passwords.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="16.1.14." ><![CDATA[<p>The minimum password length that should be required depends to a large extent on the threat model being addressed.  Online attacks where the attacker attempts to log in by guessing the password can be mitigated by limiting the rate of login attempts permitted. In order to prevent an attacker (or a persistent claimant with poor typing skills) from easily inflicting a denial-of-service attack on the subscriber by making many incorrect guesses, passwords need to be complex enough that the rate limiting does not occur after a modest number of erroneous attempts, but does occur before there is a significant chance of a successful guess.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="16.1.15." ><![CDATA[<p>Offline attacks are sometimes possible when one or more hashed passwords are obtained by the attacker through a database breach.  The ability of the attacker to determine one or more users' passwords depends on the way in which the password is stored.  Commonly, passwords are salted with a random value and hashed, preferably using a computationally expensive algorithm.  Even with such measures, the current ability of attackers to compute many billions of hashes per second with no rate limiting requires passwords intended to resist such attacks to be orders of magnitude more complex than those that are expected to resist only online attacks.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="16.1.16." ><![CDATA[<p>Users should be encouraged to make their passwords as lengthy as they want, within reason.  A reasonable upper limit is 64 characters.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="16.1.17." ><![CDATA[<p>Since the size of a hashed password is independent of its length, there is no reason not to permit the use of lengthy passwords (or passphrases) if the user wishes.  Extremely long passwords (perhaps megabytes in length) could conceivably require excessive processing time to hash, so it is reasonable to have some limit.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Password Character Set Limitations"><paragraph title="16.1.18." ><![CDATA[<p>Limitations set on credential or password length or on the use of special characters can facilitate brute-force attacks.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="16.1.19." ><![CDATA[<p>A brute-force attack is a trial-and-error method used to discover information such as a user password, a personal identification number (PIN), or to decrypt encrypted data.  Automation can be used to generate a large number of consecutive guesses.  Similar methods are used by security analysts to test an organisation's system security, often described as penetration testing.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="16.1.20." ><![CDATA[<p>Organisations should not permit the use of short or no-length passwords, restrict the use of character sets or apply encoding restrictions on entry or storage of credentials.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="16.1.21." ><![CDATA[<p>Password length, character variation and use of symbols, numbers and special characters including emoticons will increase the resistance of hash values to attack.  These practices will assist in limiting a variety of malicious attacks on IT systems.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Hashing"><paragraph title="16.1.22." ><![CDATA[<p>Hashing is a one-way function where data is mapped to a fixed-length value.  It also protects a password by producing ciphertext.  Contrast hashing with encryption is a two-way function where the data can be encrypted and decrypted.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="16.1.23." ><![CDATA[<p>In general, applications use secure hashing algorithms for:</p><ul>
<li>Password Protection;</li>
<li>Integrity checking: e.g. a tamper-evident seal for a file (checksum);</li>
<li>Authentication: e.g. Digital signatures, Hashed Message Authentication Codes (HMAC) and pseudo-random number generation (PRNG).</li>
</ul>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="16.1.24." ><![CDATA[<p>Very large passwords can create system performance issues and choke points.  Password hashing reduces all passwords to a fixed length, improving efficiency and reducing the volume of credential traffic.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="16.1.25." ><![CDATA[<p>Approved hash functions have the following characteristics:</p><ul>
<li><strong>One-way</strong>: It is computationally infeasible to find any input that maps to any pre-specified output; and</li>
<li><strong>Collision Resistant</strong>: It is computationally infeasible to find any two distinct inputs that map to the same output.</li>

</block>
<block title="Key Stretching"><paragraph title="16.1.27." ><![CDATA[<p>Key stretching is a technique of slowing the hash function as a means of discouraging attacks (making the time spent not worthwhile while increasing the length of the detection window).  Typically this is achieved through a high iteration count in the hashing process, in some cases as high as 10,000 iterations.  It is important to note the stretching of the key does not alter the entropy (randomness) of the key-space, rather it complicates the method of computing the stretched key.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="16.1.28." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS16C1">However, note the time versus security trade oﬀ here as key stretching comes at the cost of more time spent in validating user connection requests.  This is particularly apparent for transactional or high user-volume websites and networks with large numbers of users.</p>]]></paragraph>

</ul>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Shared accounts"><paragraph title="16.1.33.R.01." ><![CDATA[<p>Sharing passwords and UserIDs (credentials) may be convenient but invariably hampers efforts to identify a specific user and attribute actions to a specific person or system. While agencies and users find convenience in sharing credentials, doing so is highly risky. Shared credentials can defeat accountability and the attribution and non-repudiation principles of access control. This is particularly important where administrative access to networks and servers or access to classified information is provided through shared credentials.</p>]]></paragraph>

<block title="System user identification for shared accounts"><paragraph title="16.1.34.R.01." ><![CDATA[<p>Agencies may have a compelling business reason for the use of shared accounts. These may include Anonymous, Guest and Temporary Employee (such relieving a receptionist) credentials. It may not be possible to attribute the use of such accounts to a specific person.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="16.1.34.R.02." ><![CDATA[<p>As shared accounts are non user-specific, agencies will need to determine an appropriate method of attributing actions undertaken by such accounts to specific personnel.  For example, a logbook may be used to document the date and time that a person takes responsibility for using a shared account and the actions logged against the account by the system.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="16.1.34.C.01." classification="All Classifications" compliance="Must" cid="1837"><![CDATA[<p>If agencies choose to allow shared, non user-specific accounts they MUST ensure that an independent means of determining the identification of the system user is implemented.</p>]]></paragraph>

<block title="Identification of foreign nationals"><paragraph title="16.1.39.R.01." ><![CDATA[<p>Where systems contain NZEO or other nationalities releasability marked or protectively marked information, and foreign nationals have access to such systems, it is important that agencies implement appropriate security measures to assist in identifying users that are foreign nationals.  Such measures will assist in preventing the release of sensitive information to those not authorised to access it.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="16.1.39.C.01." classification="All Classifications" compliance="Must" cid="1850"><![CDATA[<p>Where systems contain NZEO or other nationalities releasability marked or protectively marked information, agencies MUST provide a mechanism that allows system users and processes to identify users who are foreign nationals, including seconded foreign nationals.</p>]]></paragraph>

<paragraph title="16.1.40.R.02." ><![CDATA[<p>Passwords are subject to three principal groups of risks:</p><ol>
<li>Intentional password sharing;</li>
<li>Password theft, loss or compromise; and</li>
<li>Password guessing and cracking.</li>
</ol>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="16.1.40.R.03." ><![CDATA[<p>Associated with these risk groups are four principal methods of attacking passwords:</p><ol>
<li>Interactive attempts including password guessing, brute force attacks or some knowledge of the user or agency.</li>
<li>Obtaining the password through social engineering or phishing.</li>
<li>Compromising the password through oversight, observation, use of keyloggers, cameras etc.</li>
<li>Cracking through network traffic interception, misconfiguration, malware, data capture etc. For example a simple eight-letter password can today be brute-forced in minutes by software freely available on the Internet.</li>
</ol>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="16.1.40.R.04." ><![CDATA[<p>Password controls are designed to manage these risks and attack methods using the controls specified in this section. For example, passwords with at least ten characters utilising upper and lower case, numbers and special characters have a much greater resistance to brute force attacks. When use in combination with controls such as password history and regular password change, passwords can present high resistance to known attack methods.</p>]]></paragraph>

<block title="Background"><paragraph title="16.4.4." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS16C4">Privileged Access Management (PAM) – sometimes also described as Privileged Account Management, refers to a set of processes and tools for granting, controlling, monitoring, and auditing privileged access.&nbsp;</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="16.4.5." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS16C4">A Privileged Account is a user account with high levels of access to systems, devices and data.&nbsp; Privileged accounts may, for example, be able to install or remove software, delete data, upgrade operating systems, or modify system or application configurations.&nbsp; They may also have access to data that is not normally accessible to standard users.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="16.4.6." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS16C4">Privileged Accounts invariably have direct or indirect access to most or all IT assets of an agency or organisation.  When used improperly or maliciously, privileged accounts represent a significant security threat to operations, often exposing sensitive data, impeding operations or damaging IT systems.  Any compromise of these accounts is, therefore, a significant business, operational and reputational risk.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="16.4.7." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS16C4">Risks associated with privileged accounts have increased in recent years with the expansion of endpoints and use of new technologies including Cloud, Internet of Things (IoT) and the rapid and significant increase in remote and work from home following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="16.4.8." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS16C4">Managing, controlling, monitoring and reviewing privileged access is fundamental to mitigating the risks posed by insider and external threats, privilege escalation threats, preventing unauthorised data access and data breaches, and meeting compliance requirements.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="16.4.9." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS16C4">There are many types of privileged access including:</p><ul>
<li>Root, Domain and other Administrator accounts are typically used for installing, updating and removing software, changing configurations and administering system passwords.</li>
<li>Service Accounts, which may include local or domain accounts, are typically used for running processes, such as web servers, database servers, and application servers.&nbsp; These may also include the ability to change passwords.</li>
<li>Emergency Accounts, sometimes referred to as “DRP”, “firecall” or “breakglass” accounts.&nbsp; While access to emergency accounts normally requires managerial approval as a security measure, they are typically an inefficient manual process with limited auditability.</li>
<li>System or Application Accounts are characteristically used by devices and systems for running operating system components and owning related files.</li>
</ul>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="16.4.10." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS16C4">Traditional administrative or management solutions are typically based on strong password management.&nbsp; Modern systems, especially in a cloud environment, require a more structured and robust means of access control and management.&nbsp; This should include the use of Multi-Factor Authentication (See Section 16.7 - Multi-factor Authentication) to provide access to Privileged Accounts.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="16.4.11." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS16C4">In secure environments, privileged accounts should be reserved for network and system administrators to manage the access to and oversight of sensitive information and resources in support of normal agency or organisational operations.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="16.4.12." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS16C4">The characteristics and capability of privileged accounts are described at 16.3.3.  It is important to note that systems themselves, as well as human users, may have privileged account access.  As such it is important to clearly and individually identify all real persons, systems and devices with privileged account access.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="16.4.13." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS16C4">Access accounts or channels may have the following characteristics:</p><ul>
<li>Regular access channels—protected channels that are subject to standard IT controls;</li>
<li>Privileged access channels (PACs)— channels that might circumvent regular controls but are deemed necessary and legitimate operational channels for reasons of practicality or cost;</li>
<li>Unintended channels not demanded by any technical or business requirement and represent a vulnerability.</li>
</ul>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Attacks on Privileged Accounts"><paragraph title="16.4.14." ><![CDATA[<p>Privileged accounts frequently allow unrestricted access the IT infrastructure, often including data residing on those systems.  The very high level of access and capability associated with privileged accounts makes them a prime target for external attackers and malicious insiders.  A compromise of a privileged account can be extremely damaging and may even cripple systems, such as in ransomware attacks.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="16.4.15." ><![CDATA[<p>Compromised privileged accounts represent one of the largest security vulnerabilities an organisation can face today.  A compromise will allow attackers to take full control of an organisation’s IT infrastructure, disable security controls, steal confidential information, commit financial fraud and disrupt operations.  Stolen, abused or misused privileged credentials are identified in a very high proportion of successful breaches.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="16.4.16." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS16C4">Common attack methods may include:</p><ul>
<li>Probes and scans;</li>
<li>endpoint targeting;</li>
<li>System and design vulnerability exploitation;</li>
<li>Social engineering (including phishing, email spoofing, etc); and</li>
<li>Malware implants.</li>
</ul>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Governance and Control"><paragraph title="16.4.17." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS16C4">Privileged Accounts are frequently used to deploy and maintain IT systems and necessarily exist in nearly every connected device, server, database, and application.  Privileged Accounts may extend beyond an agency-controlled IT infrastructure to include, for example, employee-managed corporate social media accounts.  Most agencies and other organisations can typically have many more privileged accounts than employees, sometimes as many as two or three times the number of employees.  It is not unusual for some privileged accounts to be unidentified, overlooked, unmanaged, and therefore unprotected.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="16.4.18." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS16C4">Governance ensures that privileged accounts are properly approved, controlled, monitored and decommissioned throughout their entire lifecycle.  A PAM Policy defines the roles, policies and mechanisms for access requests, as well as the workflow for privileged access approvals and delivery.  Monitoring and auditing ensure that account permissions and usage remain appropriate over time.  PAM governance is a fundamental part of IT Governance as it can influence other IT security systems, such as identity and access management systems.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="16.4.19." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS16C4">In order to support strong IT Governance, it is vital that security efforts are coordinated and technology investment managed.  This includes the integration of PAM into the Information Security Policy, Systems Architecture, IT Security Strategy and Risk Management Plan. The sensitivity of data and operations should be assessed by undertaking an impact assessment.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="16.4.20." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS16C4">Underpinning any PAM is the principle of enforcement of least privilege.  This is defined as the minimisation of access rights and permissions for users, accounts, applications, systems, devices and computing processes to the absolute minimum necessary in order to perform routine, authorised activities and maintain the safe and secure operation of agency or organisational systems.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="16.4.21." ><![CDATA[<p>Enforcing the principle of least privilege assists agencies in minimising their systems attack surface, supporting audit and compliance though improved visibility.  This also can reduce risk, complexity, and costs for agencies.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="16.4.22." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS16C4">Provision of unnecessary system privileges or data access rights will magnify the impact of misuse or compromise of that users account and can even be devastating.  Account privileges should be established to provide a reasonable but minimal level of system privileges and rights needed in order to support the purpose and role.  The granting of elevated or excessive system privileges should be carefully controlled and managed.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="16.4.23." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS16C4">Risks associated with access to privileged accounts include:</p><ul>
<li>Misuse of privileges;</li>
<li>Increased attacker capability;</li>
<li>Circumventing established security and oversight controls;</li>
<li>Severe system disruption or failure; and</li>
<li>Significant data compromise and/or loss.</li>
</ul>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="16.4.24." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS16C4">The principles of PAM controls are to:</p><ul>
<li>Establish and maintain an inventory of privileged accounts;</li>
<li>Assess the risk(s) of each privileged access channel;</li>
<li>Enforce the principle of least privilege;</li>
<li>Use two-factor or Multi-Factor Authentication for access to Privileged Accounts;</li>
<li>Minimise access to only essential activities;</li>
<li>Minimise the number of privileged access channels;</li>
<li>Ensure each channel and user can be uniquely identified (prevent or minimise sharing of credentials, particularly with accounts such as “root” or “admin”);</li>
<li>Ensure operational systems have access to compiled code only;</li>
<li>Ensure source code is created, managed and stored on non-operational systems only;</li>
<li>Restrict access to source code (deny-by-default);</li>
<li>Log all access to source code including the detection, evaluation, recording and termination of privileged access channels;</li>
<li>Ensure all logs are periodically reviewed;</li>
<li>Ensure strong and strict change control procedures are implemented;</li>
<li>Ensure the authorisation, activation and deactivation of privileged access channels is strictly enforced; and</li>
<li>Regularly audit and review PAM controls.</li>
</ul>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="16.4.25." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS16C4">It is also important to define all privileged accounts used by an agency or by other organisations, particularly where outsource arrangements are in place.  It is fundamental for robust security to identify and record the business functions, related data, systems and access privileges.  This is particularly important for agencies that create, store and process classified data.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="16.4.26." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS16C4">Without a comprehensive privileged accounts inventory, agencies and other organisations may overlook “backdoor” accounts which allow users to bypass proper controls and auditing.  These may have been created during system development, by malicious insiders or by external attackers.  Such unregistered accounts may be undetected for months or even years and can create a means of unauthorised and unmonitored access.  Such accounts may also be used to erase activity logs to avoid detection.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="16.4.27." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS16C4">A privileged access inventory should include a description of the IT system, information asset, privilege description, users and risk classification.  This is essential information for assessing risk, the determining of controls and for identifying and managing use and misuse.<strong>  </strong>Of note are:</p><ul>
<li>Local or Domain Server Admin accounts;</li>
<li>Domain Admin accounts that typically control Active Directory users;</li>
<li>System Admin accounts that manage databases;</li>
<li>Root accounts that manage Unix/Linux platforms;</li>
<li>Accounts that run and manage Windows applications, services, and scheduled tasks;</li>
<li>IIS application pools (.NET applications);</li>
<li>Networking equipment accounts that give access to firewalls, routers, switches, session border controllers, gateways and other similar devices, whether physical or virtual.</li>
</ul>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="16.4.28." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS16C4">Privileged Access Management systems provide many of the capabilities and controls briefly described above and can facilitate PAM, as well as supporting strong IT Governance.</p>]]></paragraph>

<block title="Background"><paragraph title="16.7.4." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS16C7">Authentication is a key element of security that provides confirmation of the identity of all parties to a transaction.  In this context a transaction may include browsing, financial operations and all types of data access, creation, copying and deletion.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="16.7.5." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS16C7">Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is a security system that verifies a user’s identity by requiring multiple credentials, which may be of the same factor or type.  Initial authentication often requires a username and password followed by a requirement for other (additional) credentials.  It is important to recognise that MFA authentication is not necessarily the same as Two-Factor Authentication or Dual-Factor Authentication.  MFA can enable, for example, valid users’ access to permit credential reset, even if they are using a username and password that may have been compromised.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="16.7.6." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS16C7">Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is a strong defence and deterrent against many credential attacks, including brute-force, credential stuffing and password spraying attacks.  It also defends against social engineering attacks seeking user credentials.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="16.7.7." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS16C7">Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) incorporates Two-Factor Authentication (2FA), which is also briefly discussed in Section 16.1 – Identification, Authentication and Passwords.&nbsp; 2FA requires two elements from any of the three factors of authentication and with the second factor from a different group to the first factor selected.&nbsp; These factors or groups are:</p><ol>
<li>Something you have (preferably NOT the device itself but a SEPARATE authentication device such as a token, RFID card or smartcard).&nbsp; This is also known as the possession or ownership factor;</li>
<li>Something you know such as a PIN, One-Time Password (OTP), reusable password, pattern or other component of a standard authentication mechanism.&nbsp; This is also described as the knowledge factor;</li>
<li>Something you are (physical characteristics or biometrics of various types).&nbsp; This is also described as the inherence factor.</li>
</ol>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="16.7.8." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS16C7">MFA is frequently used where the assurance provided by username and password is inadequate.  Additional authenticators increase attack resistance and reduce risk of unauthorised access. Additional authentication also assists in managing Privileged Access (refer to Section 16.4 – Privileged Access Management).</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="16.7.9." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS16C7">MFA is most effective when knowledge, possession, and inherence authentication factors are used as compensating factors for other authentication weaknesses.  This is discussed in more detail in 16.7.16 below.  Using MFA increases attack resistance by increasing the difficulty of obtaining all necessary authenticators.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="16.7.10." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS16C7">It is important to use a variety of factors to strengthen attack resistance in order to increase confidence levels in the chosen authentication system.  For example, using a second factor from the knowledge group is less effective as passwords are inherently part of the knowledge group.  Knowledge groups are most exposed to attack and compromise through social engineering.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="16.7.11." ><![CDATA[<p>To maximise the effectiveness and security of any Multi-Factor Authentication construct, the authentication service should be dedicated, hardened and isolated within the network’s security architecture.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="SMS"><paragraph title="16.7.12." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS16C7">There are several known vulnerabilities in SMS which may make it unsuitable and unsafe for authentication purposes.  Vulnerabilities include:</p><ul>
<li>Hackers have been able to mislead and persuade carriers and service providers into porting a phone number to a new device through a SIM swap.  This can often be achieved with minimal personal information such as your phone number, date of birth, full name, the last four digits of your bank card access number, bank account number, mobile device number, Social Security number or similar information.  Users often store bank cards with their mobile device so if the device is stolen or simply accessed temporarily, this data can also be accessed.  Once the phone number has been redirected, physical access to your device is no longer required.  Any SMS codes are then subject to compromise.</li>
<li>If text messages are synched with or duplicated on a laptop, tablet or other personal device, then SMS are vulnerable if the device used by another person or if the device is stolen.</li>
<li>There are vulnerabilities in mobile telecommunication infrastructure in what's described as a SS7 (Signalling System 7) attack.  An SS7 attack is an exploit that takes advantage of a weakness in the design of SS7 which can enable data theft, eavesdropping, text interception and location tracking.  SS7 is a protocol dating from the mid-1970’s and almost all telecommunication service providers have now implemented security measures to counter SS7 exploits.  Social engineering remains a risk.</li>
</ul>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Key Benefits"><paragraph title="16.7.13." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS16C7">The principal benefits of MFA include:</p><ul>
<li>Strengthened security and credential protection;</li>
<li>Streamlined user access;</li>
<li>Reduced administrative overhead;</li>
<li>Increased security visibility; and</li>
<li>Improved compliance.</li>
</ul>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Adaptive Authentication"><paragraph title="16.7.14." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS16C7">Adaptive Authentication varies the level or degree of authentication required where an unusual authentication request occurs.&nbsp; For example, out of normal hours, from an unusual geolocation, from an unrecognised device, from an unrecognised IP address and so on.&nbsp; When an unusual authentication request is received, Adaptive Authentication may request additional credentials such as a one-time code provided to a known mobile phone number. &nbsp;Some risk factors that may trigger Adaptive Authentication include:</p><ul>
<li>The location of the access request such as such as a café, airport or home;</li>
<li>The time of the access request such as like late at night, over weekends or during normal working hours;</li>
<li>The type of device, such as a smartphone, tablet, laptop or unrecognised device;</li>
<li>The type of connection, for example, a public network such as the internet, or a VPN or some other private network; and</li>
<li>A request for access to privileged accounts.</li>
</ul><p>&nbsp;</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="16.7.15." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS16C7">Adaptive authentication includes what is sometimes described as transaction identification where known characteristics are compared to the transaction or access request.  For example a known location or common access request.  If known characteristics do not match then additional authentication steps may be indicated or required.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Client-Side Authentication"><paragraph title="16.7.16." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS16C7">Client-side authentication originates from the user’s device such as laptop, mobile phone, tablet or home computer.&nbsp; These devices may provide a variety of authentication methods including:</p><ul>
<li>Inherence factor/Biometric:
<ul>
<li>Fingerprint scans;</li>
<li>Facial recognition;</li>
<li>Voice command/recognition;</li>
<li>Iris scans;</li>
<li>Keystroke dynamics;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Knowledge factor:
<ul>
<li>PIN codes;</li>
<li>Pattern codes;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Possession factor:
<ul>
<li>Geofencing;</li>
<li>Bluetooth device proximity/Near field communication (NFC).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="16.7.17." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS16C7">It is important to note that some biometric and other measures, for example fingerprints, are susceptible to attacks such as spoofing.  To combat these biometric attacks secondary measures are also required, for example pulse-sensing in addition to fingerprint detection in order to ensure the fingerprint presentation is a live person.  Clearly not all secondary measures are fully effective in themselves and multiple secondary measures may be required for high risk/high value authorisation requests.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Single-User and Multi-User Authorisation"><paragraph title="16.7.18." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS16C7">Single-User authorisation&nbsp;involves prompting the account holder to authorise an action being taken on his behalf.&nbsp; For example, single-user authorisation can even prevent fraud as it occurs in a user-friendly manner.&nbsp; Instead of calling the customer to verify the legitimacy of a purchase, credit card companies could request customer authentication for an on-line purchase by sending an authorisation request to the customer through an alternate channel such as a mobile phone.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="16.7.19." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS16C7">Multi-User authorisation usually requires multiple and separate authentications (usually people) in order to authorise a transaction or event, such as establishing an account.&nbsp; This system supports the “separation of duties” concept common in accounting transactions or other high risk activities.&nbsp; Another example is a password change for a privileged account.&nbsp; Multiuser authorisation may also assess risk indicators and context (e.g. time, location) to select the authentication components and requirements.</p>]]></paragraph>

<block title="Multi-Step Authentication"><paragraph title="16.7.20." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS16C7">Multi-step Authentication is a design and architectural approach to control access to resources by sequentially using multiple authentication verifiers. &nbsp;Each authentication step grants access to increasingly privileged areas of the system until access to the desired resources is reached (refer also to 16.4 – Privileged Access Management). &nbsp;Multi-Step Authentication can be activated by risk-based “triggers” where risk factors are identified.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="16.7.21." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS16C7">Multi-step Authentication may require only one authentication factor or mechanism, so it is important not to confuse Multi-Step Authentication with Multi-Factor Authentication.  Multi-Step Authentication may not be as secure as MFA and cannot be an appropriate substitute for MFA.  A key risk is repeated use of a single authentication factor.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="16.7.22." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS16C7">It is also worth noting, however, that Multi-Step combined with Multi-Factor Authentication is a strong architectural security construct, particularly when separate authentication factors are required at each step when accessing privileged accounts.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Perfect Forward Secrecy"><paragraph title="16.7.23." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS16C7">In addition to the encryption protocols and algorithms discussed in Chapter 17 - Cryptography, the concept of Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS), often simplified to Forward Secrecy, should also be incorporated into any authentication mechanism design.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="16.7.24." ><![CDATA[<p>Forward Secrecy is a property of secure communication protocols that is intended to prevent a compromised encryption key from being used to decrypt previously encrypted traffic. &nbsp;Clearly a compromised key must be immediately replaced in order to maintain the integrity of communications.&nbsp; This mechanism is described as a “rolling secrets” technique and is designed to prevent device spoofing and the cloning of mobile clients.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="16.7.25." ><![CDATA[<p>A “rolling secret” key is located on the client device.&nbsp; The client receives two encrypted packages.&nbsp; The first contains another private key and is decrypted by the current private key held on the client device.&nbsp; The new key is used to decrypt the second package and the new private key replaces the existing private key, which is then discarded.&nbsp; The new key is used to encrypt traffic to the authentication server.&nbsp; With each cycle the client replaces the old key with the new key.</p>]]></paragraph>

<block title="Cryptography"><paragraph title="16.7.26." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS16C7">The use of encryption is a fundamental component is the security of a Multi-Factor Authentication mechanism.&nbsp; It is essential that only approved cryptographic protocols and algorithms are used, refer to <a title="Cryptography" href="http://nzism.gcsb.govt.nz/ism-document#Chapter-15745">Chapter 17 – Cryptography</a>.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Risk Analysis"><paragraph title="16.7.27." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS16C7">The design of Multi-Factor Authentication should start with a risk review in order to identify any existing and new risks from changing environments, user populations and threat landscapes.  Some early steps will include:</p><ul>
<li>Review business drivers, existing identity infrastructure, enterprise applications, core platform infrastructure and development plans for each of these;</li>
<li>Ensure any plans for cloud and related services are reviewed and incorporated;</li>
<li>Identify authentication use cases including employees and contractors, consumers, customers, partners, and suppliers.  For Digital Government this may also include the General Public for some systems;</li>
<li>Develop baseline requirements;</li>
<li>Undertake a threat analysis for each use case; and</li>
</ul><p>Select control mechanisms to manage identified risks.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="16.7.28." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS16C7">This risk analysis will inform and direct the development of an authentication architecture to provide robust but usable security for each use case.  Some key questions include:</p><ul>
<li>How will users access the system or application?</li>
<li>At what stage will users be authenticated?</li>
<li>What authentication factors will provide the appropriate level of authentication and security?</li>
<li>Is the level of authentication appropriate to secure and protect the systems, data and other related assets? and</li>
<li>Is there sufficient capacity to service anticipated workloads?</li>
</ul>]]></paragraph>

<block title="Governance and Control"><paragraph title="16.7.29." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS16C7">Good governance processes assist in identifying potential risks to your systems, data, employees, partners and contractors and reduces the risk of a breach or failure to comply with legislation and regulation.  Good governance processes support the fulfilment of fiduciary duties of senior and executive management.</p>]]></paragraph>

Cryptographic Fundamentals"><subsection title="Objective"><paragraph title="17.1.1." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS17C1">Agencies use cryptographic products, algorithms and protocols that are approved by the GCSB and are implemented in accordance with this guidance.</p>]]></paragraph>
 </subsection>
<subsection title="Context"> <block title="Scope"><paragraph title="17.1.2." ><![CDATA[<p>This section covers information on the fundamentals of cryptography including the use of encryption to protect data at rest and in transit. &nbsp;Detailed information on algorithms and protocols approved to protect classified information can be found in <a href="http://nzism.gcsb.govt.nz/ism-document#Section-15853">Section 17.2 - Approved Cryptographic Algorithms</a> and <a href="http://nzism.gcsb.govt.nz/ism-document#Section-15924">Section 17.3 - Approved Cryptographic Protocols</a>.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Purpose of cryptography"><paragraph title="17.1.3." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS17C1">Cryptography is primarily used to support:</p><ul>
<li>Confidentiality – protecting against the risk of information being disclosed to an unauthorised person;</li>
<li>Authentication – ensuring a person or entity is who they claim to be;</li>
<li>Integrity – ensuring information has not been compromised, either deliberately or accidentally; and</li>
<li>Non-repudiation – proving who (or what) performed an action. </li>
</ul>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="17.1.4." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS17C1">Cryptography is an important control for data protection. The encryption selected may change depending on the classification of the data.  It is important to note that classification, in itself, provides no protection but is merely a labelling mechanism to indicate the degree of protection and care required in handling that data.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="17.1.5." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS17C1">Cryptography is frequently used in the establishment of secure connectivity (e.g. IPSec VPNs) and in trust frameworks such as those supported by Public Key Infrastructure (PKI).</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="17.1.6." ><![CDATA[<p>With the increases in speed and computing power and the cost reductions of modern computing, older cryptographic algorithms are increasingly vulnerable.  It is vital that recommendations and controls in the NZISM are followed.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="17.1.7." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS17C1">Mitigation of the risks when using older cryptographic algorithms, often takes the form of increased key lengths.  Agencies should also note the increasing threat posed by the evolution and development of quantum computing (see 17.1.19 - Quantum Computing and Encryption).</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Encryption"><paragraph title="17.1.8." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS17C1">Encryption is the process of converting plain (readable) text to an unintelligible form (cipher text).  The term encryption is often used synonymously with cryptography.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="17.1.9." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS17C1">The use of approved encryption will generally reduce the likelihood of an unauthorised party gaining access to the information contained within the encrypted data.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="17.1.10." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS17C1">When data is at rest, encryption can be used to reduce the physical protection and handling requirements of media or systems. This does not change the classification of the underlying data system or equipment.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="17.1.11." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS17C1">Care needs to be taken with encryption systems that do not encrypt the entire media content to ensure that either all of the classified data is encrypted or that the media is handled in accordance with the highest classification of the unencrypted data.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="17.1.12." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS17C1">Encryption of data in transit can be used to provide protection for information being communicated over insecure media and hence reduce the security requirements of the communication process.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="17.1.13." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS17C1">It is important to note that when agencies use encryption for data at rest or in transit, they are <strong>not</strong> reducing the <strong>classification</strong> of the information. When encryption is used the potential risk of disclosure of the information is reduced.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="17.1.14." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS17C1">As the classification of the information <strong>does not </strong>change when encrypted, agencies cannot use lowered storage, physical transfer or security requirements as a baseline to further lower requirements with an additional cryptographic product.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="17.1.15." ><![CDATA[<p>In general terms, the level of assurance of specific encryption protocols and algorithms is defined in terms of Common Criteria, Protection Profiles or, in some cases, approved cryptographic evaluations.  It is important to note that evaluations of cryptographic protocols and algorithms are <strong>NOT</strong> universally conducted when security products are evaluated, relying rather on previous approved evaluations of cryptographic protocols and algorithms.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Risk Assessments"><paragraph title="17.1.16." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS17C1">Encryption algorithms apply data transformations that are designed to be difficult to reverse by unauthorised users.  Today’s software will usually provide several algorithmic options, but may include some older algorithms provided for backward compatibility with older (legacy) systems.  In many cases the older algorithms are deprecated, are considered time-expired and are not fit for purpose in modern systems. Deprecated algorithms should not be used.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="17.1.17." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS17C1">In all cases a comprehensive risk assessment should be undertaken before configurations are selected.&nbsp; Some general principles to be considered are:</p><ul>
<li>Cryptographic strength is determined by a combination of the encryption algorithm being used, the encryption protocol and the key length.&nbsp; Longer keys generally provide increased encryption strength over shorter keys when using the same encryption algorithm;</li>
<li>Asymmetric cryptographic algorithms are slower than symmetric cryptographic algorithms at an equivalent cryptographic strength;</li>
<li>Asymmetric cryptographic algorithms are recommended for the exchange of symmetric cryptographic keys when they are needed to be shared across communication channels;</li>
<li>Encrypted data cannot usually be compressed, but compressed data can be encrypted.&nbsp; Data should be compressed before encryption;</li>
<li>Encryption keys have the same requirements for handling and storage as the unencrypted data they are being used to protect;</li>
<li>Any risk assessment should include consideration of key management – refer to <a href="http://nzism.gcsb.govt.nz/ism-document#Section-16086">section 17.9 Key Management</a>.</li>
</ul>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="17.1.18." ><![CDATA[<p>It is important to note that the NZISM prescribes approved algorithms and protocols and users must select combinations from these lists.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Quantum Computing and Encryption"><paragraph title="17.1.19." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS17C1">Developments in quantum computing have highlighted threats to classical cryptography whereby a quantum computing, can undermine all of the widely used public key algorithms used for key establishment and digital signatures.  While this may be not an immediate issue, quantum developments are likely to undermine the effectiveness of encryption being used today to protect confidentiality of information.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="17.1.20." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS17C1">A further implication is that historical and archived data protected by encryption may be at risk.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="17.1.21." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS17C1">It is generally accepted that symmetric encryption, with sufficiently long keys, will remain quantum resistant in the short term but that quantum resistant replacements for digital signature and key establishment algorithms will be required in the near future.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="17.1.22." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS17C1">In the longer term, quantum resistant algorithms are expected to be developed, standardised and approved for use.  Until such time, however, agencies should be positioning themselves to be ready to migrate to a “post-quantum encryption” environment.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="17.1.23." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS17C1">As it is now recognised that agencies will need to undertake future migration activities related to post-quantum encryption, it is no longer specifically advised to invest in migration from RSA to ECC-based algorithms if that has not already taken place.  Emphasis should instead be placed on ensuring minimum key lengths specified in the NZISM are adhered to.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Transitioning Cryptographic Algorithms and Protocols"><paragraph title="17.1.24." ><![CDATA[<p>It is important to use algorithms that adequately protect sensitive information.  It is also important to recognise that all cryptographic algorithms and protocols have a finite life.  Challenges are posed by new cryptanalysis techniques and methods, the increasing power of classical computing technology, and the continuing work on the development of quantum computers.  In addition, there is an active field of work that continuously seeks to compromise algorithms and protocols currently in use.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="17.1.25." ><![CDATA[<p>Planning for changes in the use of cryptography because of algorithm breaks, the availability of more powerful computing techniques or new technologies is an important consideration for agencies.  Awareness of retirement or deprecation of algorithms and associated protocols is essential.</p>]]></paragraph>

<block title="RSA "><paragraph title="17.1.26." ><![CDATA[<p>RSA was announced in 1976 and is now over 45 years old. Several flaws and attacks have been identified since creation, each of which required specific mitigations, careful implementation and management.  Unfortunately there is ample evidence that implementers continue to have difficulties in securely implementing, using and managing RSA.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="17.1.27." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS17C1">To counter identified threats from shorter RSA key lengths, longer key lengths have been specified in the NZISM since 2010.  Minimum key lengths have been subsequently increased over time.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="17.1.28." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS17C1">For a number of years there had been several indicators that RSA was likely to be deprecated by the cryptographic community and standards bodies.  For example, TLS 1.3 has deprecated the use of RSA for key exchange in favour of elliptic curve cryptography, but RSA is still supported for digital signatures in the current standard.  Previous guidance from NIST was also indicative of the impending deprecation of RSA.  However, subsequent guidance no longer recommends moving from RSA to elliptic curve if that has not already been done.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="17.1.29." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS17C1">Therefore, while RSA is not fully deprecated in the NZISM, it is approved ONLY for a limited set of uses as described in <a title="Approved cryptographic algorithms" href="http://nzism.gcsb.govt.nz/ism-document#Section-15853">Section 17.2 – Approved Cryptographic Algorithms</a>.</p>]]></paragraph>

<block title="Product specific cryptographic requirements"><paragraph title="17.1.30." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS17C1">This section provides requirements for the use of cryptography to protect classified information.  Requirements, in addition to those in this Manual, can exist in consumer guides for products once they have completed an approved evaluation.  Vendor specifications supplement this manual and where conflict in controls occurs the product specific requirements take precedence.  Any policy or compliance conflicts are to be incorporated into the risk assessment.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Exceptions for using cryptographic products"><paragraph title="17.1.31." ><![CDATA[<p>Where Agencies implement a product that uses an Approved Cryptographic Algorithm or Approved Cryptographic Protocol to provide protection of unclassified data at rest or in transit, that product does not require a separate, approved evaluation.  Correct implementation of the cryptographic protocol is fundamental to the proper operation of the Approved Cryptographic Algorithm or Approved Cryptographic Protocol and is part of the checking conducted during system certification.</p>]]></paragraph>

<block title="Federal Information Processing Standard 140"><paragraph title="17.1.32." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS17C1">FIPS 140 is a United States standard for the evaluation and validation of both hardware and software cryptographic modules.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="17.1.33." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS17C1">FIPS 140 is in its third iteration and is formally referred to as FIPS 140-3.  This section refers to the standard as FIPS 140 but this should be considered to encompass FIPS 140-1, FIPS 140-2 and FIPS 140-3.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="17.1.34." ><![CDATA[<p>FIPS 140 is not a substitute for an approved evaluation of a product with cryptographic functionality.  FIPS 140 is concerned solely with the cryptographic functionality of a module and does not consider any other security functionality.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="17.1.35." ><![CDATA[<p>Cryptographic evaluations of products will normally be conducted by an approved agency.  Where a product’s cryptographic functionality has been validated under FIPS 140, the GCSB can, at its discretion, and in consultation with the vendor, reduce the scope of a cryptographic evaluation.</p>]]></paragraph>

<paragraph title="17.1.40." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS17C1">Indirect agency control is described as when information is not under the direct control of the agency, this may be through outsourcing, ICT management or services, third party facilities such as data centre co-locations, or consumption of cloud services (see 2.2.5 – 2.2.7).</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="17.1.41." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS17C1">Encryption can be used to protect information not under the direct control of the agency.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="17.1.42." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS17C1">The use of encryption (including data encryption, use of a VPN or any other form of protection using cryptography) requires cryptographic key management and the retention of control of both keys and key management processes. </p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="17.1.43." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS17C1">Where agencies make use of VPNs or other forms of network connectivity that protect data in transit, the control and management of the cryptographic key is fundamental to the integrity and confidentiality of the encrypted data.</p>]]></paragraph>

<paragraph title="17.1.46." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS17C1">The selection of the cryptographic protocol and algorithm is described in this chapter and specified in 17.1.55.C.02. It is essential that agencies select and use only approved cryptographic algorithms and protocols (see <a title="Approved Cryptographic Protocols" href="http://nzism.gcsb.govt.nz/ism-document#Section-15853">section 17.2 – Approved Cryptographic Protocols</a>) and apply the cryptographic key management requirements of the NZISM (see <a title="Key management" href="http://nzism.gcsb.govt.nz/ism-document#Section-16086">section 17.9 - Key Management</a>).</p>]]></paragraph>

</ul>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="17.1.49." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS17C1">It is important to understand that a variety of VPN services can use a variety of mechanisms.&nbsp; Agencies should also consider the service provider’s use of hash authentication, perfect forward secrecy, and the difference in encryption settings on both the data and control channels.&nbsp; The NZISM specifies the cryptographic protocols and cryptographic algorithms that should be used (see sections <a title="Approved Cryptographic algorithms" href="http://nzism.gcsb.govt.nz/ism-document#Section-15853">17.2 – Approved Cryptographic Algorithms</a> and <a title="Approved Cryptographic Protocols" href="http://nzism.gcsb.govt.nz/ism-document#Section-15924">17.3 – Approved Cryptographic Protocols</a>) and agencies must ensure the VPN connection conforms with these requirements.</p>]]></paragraph>

In some cases, no physical security can be applied to the communications infrastructure such as public infrastructure, the Internet or non-agency controlled infrastructure.

<block title="Approved cryptographic algorithms"><paragraph title="17.2.4." ><![CDATA[<p>There is no guarantee or proof of security of an algorithm against presently unknown attacks.  However, the algorithms listed in this section have been extensively scrutinised by government, industry and academic communities in a practical and theoretical setting and have not been found to be susceptible to any feasible attacks.  There have been some cases where theoretically impressive vulnerabilities have been found, however these results are not considered to be feasible with current technologies and capabilities.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="17.2.5." ><![CDATA[<p>Where there is a range of possible key sizes for an algorithm, some of the smaller key sizes do not provide an adequate safety margin against attacks that might be found in the future.  For example, future advances in number factorisation could render the use of smaller RSA moduli a security vulnerability.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="17.2.6." ><![CDATA[<p>The approved cryptographic algorithms fall into three categories: asymmetric/public key algorithms, hashing algorithms and symmetric encryption algorithms.  Collectively these were known as SUITE B and were first promulgated in 2006.</p>]]></paragraph>

<block title="Salting"><paragraph title="17.2.14." ><![CDATA[<p>Salting is a technique of further modifying a hash by adding a value or character string to the start or end of a password.  This improves the resistance of the hash to brute-force attacks.  To further improve resistance the salt should be cryptographically strong and randomly generated as unique for each password.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="17.2.15." ><![CDATA[<p>The effectiveness of salts is reduced if implemented poorly.  Common implementation errors are salts that are too short and the reuse of salts.  To implement credential-specific salts the following principles should be followed:</p><ul>
<li>Generation of a unique salt every time a stored credential is created;</li>
<li>Generate salts as cryptographically strong random data;</li>
<li>Use a 32 or 64 bit salt as storage and system constraints permit;</li>
<li>Implement a security schema that is not dependent on hiding, splitting or otherwise obfuscating the salt; and</li>
<li>Do NOT apply salts per user or on a system wide basis.</li>

<block title="Background"><paragraph title="17.4.5." ><![CDATA[<p><strong>Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)</strong>, and <strong>Transport Layer Security (TLS)</strong> are cryptographic protocols designed to provide communication security when using the Internet.  They use X.509 certificates and asymmetric cryptography for authentication purposes.  This generates a session key.  This session key is then used to encrypt data between the parties.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="17.4.6." ><![CDATA[<p>Encryption with the session key provides data and message confidentiality, and message authentication codes for message integrity.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="17.4.7." ><![CDATA[<p>Several versions of the SSL and TLS protocols are in widespread use in applications such as web browsing, electronic mail, Internet faxing, instant messaging, and voice-over-IP (VoIP).</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="17.4.8." ><![CDATA[<p>Although common usage has been to use the terms TLS and SSL interchangeably, they are distinct protocols.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="17.4.9." ><![CDATA[<p>TLS is an Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) protocol, first defined in 1999, updated in RFC 5246 (August 2008) and RFC 6176 (March 2011).  It is based on the earlier SSL specifications (1994, 1995, 1996) developed by Netscape Communications for adding the HTTPS protocol to their Navigator web browser.  A draft of TLS 1.3 was released in October 2014, with a definitive version issued in 2018.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="17.4.10." ><![CDATA[<p>Microsoft announced in October 2014 that that it will disable Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) 3.0 support in its Internet Explorer browser and in its Online Services, from Dec. 1, 2014.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="SSL 3.0 Vulnerability"><paragraph title="17.4.11." ><![CDATA[<p>A design vulnerability has been found in the way SSL 3.0 handles block cipher mode padding.  The Padding Oracle On Downgraded Legacy Encryption (POODLE) attack demonstrates how an attacker can exploit this vulnerability to decrypt and extract information from an encrypted transaction.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="17.4.12." ><![CDATA[<p>The POODLE attack demonstrates this vulnerability using web browsers and web servers, which is one of the most likely exploitation scenarios.  All systems and applications utilizing the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) 3.0 with cipher-block chaining (CBC) mode ciphers may be vulnerable.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="SSL Superseded"><paragraph title="17.4.13." ><![CDATA[<p>SSL is now superseded by TLS, with the latest version being TLS 1.3 which was released in August 2018.  This is largely because of security flaws in the older SSL protocols.</p>]]></paragraph>

</block>
<block title="Background"><paragraph title="17.9.8." ><![CDATA[<p>Encryption is an unparalleled technology for the protection of information, but it relies on the strength of the algorithm, the strength of the key and, most importantly, strong key management.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="17.9.9." ><![CDATA[<p>All encryption has four important characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li>the value of the data to be protected and the level of protection required to protect it,</li>
<li>the algorithm used to encrypt the data,</li>
<li>the protocol used to apply the algorithm, and</li>
<li>the encryption key.</li>
</ul>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="17.9.10." ><![CDATA[<p>In almost all cases the algorithm is in the public domain and is not a secret. &nbsp;When an encryption algorithm is publicly available, security rests entirely on the secrecy of the encryption key. &nbsp;It is also true that the effectiveness of most encryption systems depends on the secrecy of the encryption key. &nbsp;Approved Cryptographic Algorithms are described in <a href="http://nzism.gcsb.govt.nz/ism-document#Section-15853">Section 17.2</a>. and Approved Cryptographic Protocols (applying the algorithms) are described in <a href="http://nzism.gcsb.govt.nz/ism-document#Section-15924">Section 17.3</a>. &nbsp;These sections also specify key strengths to resist attempts to compromise the key through cryptanalysis.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="17.9.11." ><![CDATA[<p>While any algorithm can, theoretically, be broken through cryptanalysis, this may require the use of vast computing power and other resources, making this approach infeasible. &nbsp;If, however, the encryption key is compromised, there is no need to attack the algorithm itself. &nbsp;Attacks on encryption systems will likely target the weakest point, most frequently these are the safeguards that are used to protection the key. &nbsp;Attempts to compromise keys and key management are more likely and more efficient than attacks on the algorithm itself. &nbsp;This is why strong key management is vital in order to protect the encryption key and keep the key secure and secret. &nbsp;When key management fails, cryptographic security is compromised.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="17.9.12." ><![CDATA[<p>Almost all internet security protocols use cryptography for authentication, integrity, confidentiality, and non-repudiation. It is vital that good key management is implemented if these security protocols are to be protected, considered reliable, and provide required levels of assurance to organisations and users.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="17.9.13." ><![CDATA[<p>In some cases, trusted third-party key management service providers furnish assistance to agencies in the generation, storage, operation, management, and retirement of keys associated with the agency.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Key management"><paragraph title="17.9.14." ><![CDATA[<p>For encryption to be used effectively, the encryption keys must be managed and protected with the same care and security as the data originally encrypted, as long as the same key is being used to decrypt or recover data.&nbsp;</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="17.9.15." ><![CDATA[<p>Key management encompasses the operations and tasks necessary to create, protect, and control the use of cryptographic keys. &nbsp;The process from creation to destruction of the encryption key is described as the key management life cycle.</p>]]></paragraph>

<block title="Open networks"><paragraph title="17.9.17." ><![CDATA[<p>Open networks, by definition, seek to establish arbitrary connections without there necessarily being a pre-existing relationship. &nbsp;Protocols have been developed to manage this requirement through key exchange protocols and through trusted agents, most often a National Authority or Certificate Authority. &nbsp;Again it is important that approved protocols and algorithms, as specified in this document, are used. Refer to sections <a href="http://nzism.gcsb.govt.nz/ism-document#Section-15853">17.2 Approved Cryptographic Algorithms</a> and <a href="http://nzism.gcsb.govt.nz/ism-document#Section-15924">17.3 Approved Cryptographic Protocols</a>.</p>]]></paragraph>

PKI has many different applications, and typically is used for encrypting and digitally signing data in order to authenticate and protect data in transmission, and supporting confidentiality and privacy.&nbsp; It is used extensively in ecommerce, internet banking, and secure email as well as being a key element in protecting website traffic.<strong><br></strong></p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Outsourcing key management"><paragraph title="17.9.19." ><![CDATA[<p>The goal of key management, both for use within an organisation or in the cloud, is to enable data encryption by securing access to cryptographic keys.

<paragraph title="17.9.20." ><![CDATA[<p>As stated previously, the ownership, control, and possession are three key aspects relevant to key management.

<block title="Commonly used key management scenarios "><paragraph title="17.9.23." ><![CDATA[<p>Within industry a number of&nbsp;approaches are available to manage end users’ cryptographic keys. There are variations in how these may be defined, therefore an awareness around how role attribution is allocated within a provider’s own key management offering is an important consideration when deciding on a solution.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Example 1:</strong> The provider generates, manages, and stores the encryption and decryption keys. This option may reduce the amount of overhead an agency outlays compared to if they maintain their own key infrastructure. However, if an agency changes providers this may present challenges around compatibility, as well as financial implications.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="/assets/NZISM/17.9.23-Key-Management-Example-1.png" alt="" width="436" height="265" class="ss-htmleditorfield-file image" loading="lazy"></p>
<p><strong>Example 2:</strong> The customer generates and manages encryption keys, and the cloud provider can access the keys to encrypt and decrypt the customer’s data. This option may reduce the level of control an agency has over the confidentiality of their data. A key consideration for choosing this option is likely to be the sensitivity of the data to be stored.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="/assets/NZISM/17.9.23-Key-Management-Example-2.png" alt="" width="424" height="206" class="center ss-htmleditorfield-file image" loading="lazy"></p>
<p><strong>Example 3:</strong> An Agency generates and manages encryption keys including its storage. Data encryption occurs prior to movement into a cloud environment. The provider does not have access to file content. This option may be more suitable for agencies that require greater security around sensitive data. The cloud environment is used for storing the customer’s encrypted data.&nbsp;</p>

<paragraph title="17.9.24." ><![CDATA[<p>The following includes considerations that should form part of a technical evaluation when deciding on a key management solution.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>The value of data to be stored including protection requirements for that data.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Whether the key management solution can be integrated with other data storage services.&nbsp;</li>

<block title="Risks"><paragraph title="17.9.25." ><![CDATA[<p>There are a number of specific risks related to the management of cryptographic keys. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keys exposed to unauthorised persons or applications, potentially compromising the keys or data the encryption is protecting.</li>
<li>Lost or unrecoverable cryptographic keys.</li>
<li>Software based key management, which provides only limited protection.</li>
<li>Fragmented key management as new systems are introduced such as when changes occur to the physical custody of hardware outside of a trusted environment.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Poorly documented and understood key management processes and activities increasing the possibility of compromise and potentially increasing compliance costs.</li>
<li>Inadequate separation of duties within the ownership, control, and possession of keys, resulting in non-compatible duties being allocated to the same party, potentially resulting in unauthorised access of tenancy data.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Lack of interoperability if an agency’s key management infrastructure is not compatible with that offered by a cloud service provider.</li>
</ul>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="17.9.26." ><![CDATA[<p>Several factors should be understood and assessed conjointly to enable decisions on which key management option is most suitable for security and business requirements. These factors include:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>

</block>
<block title="Hardware Security Module"><paragraph title="17.10.3." ><![CDATA[<p>Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) are defined as a hardware module or appliance which provides cryptographic functions.  HSM’s can be integrated into a design, installed in a host or be externally connected.  HSM’s can be packaged as discrete appliances, PCI cards, USB devices, smartcards or other form factors.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="17.10.4." ><![CDATA[<p>Functions include (but are not limited to) encryption, decryption, key generation, signing, hashing and cryptographic acceleration.  The appliance usually also offers some level of physical tamper-resistance, has a user interface and a programmable interface for key management, configuration and firmware or software updates.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Usage"><paragraph title="17.10.5." ><![CDATA[<p>HSMs are used in high assurance security solutions that satisfy widely established and emerging standards of due care for cryptographic systems and practices—while also maintaining high levels of operational efficiency.  Traditional use of HSMs is within automatic teller machines, electronic fund transfer, and point-of-sale networks.  HSMs are also used to secure CA keys in PKI deployments, SSL acceleration and DNSSEC (DNS Security Extensions) implementations.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Physical Security"><paragraph title="17.10.6." ><![CDATA[<p>HSM’s usually describe an encapsulated multi-chip module, device, card or appliance, rather than a single chip component or device.  The nature of HSM’s requires more robust physical security, including tamper resistance, tamper evidence, tamper detection, and tamper response.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Tamper Resistance"><paragraph title="17.10.7." ><![CDATA[<p>Tamper Resistance is designed to limit the ability to physically tamper with, break into or extract useful information from an HSM.  Often the boards and components are encased in an epoxy-like resin that will destroy any encapsulated components when drilled, scraped or otherwise physically tampered with.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Tamper Evidence"><paragraph title="17.10.8." ><![CDATA[<p>The HSM is designed so that any attempts at tampering are evident.  Many devices use seals and labels designed break or reveal a special message when physical tampering is attempted.  Tamper evidence may require a regular inspection or audit mechanism.</p>]]></paragraph>

<block title="802.1X Authentication"><paragraph title="18.2.9.R.01." ><![CDATA[<p>A number of Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) methods, supported by the Wi-Fi Protected Access 2 (WPA2) protocol, are available.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="18.2.9.R.02." ><![CDATA[<p>Agencies deploying a secure wireless network can choose WPA2-Enterprise with EAP-Transport Layer Security (EAP-TLS), WPA2-Enterprise with EAP-Tunnelled Transport Layer Security (EAP-TTLS) or WPA2-Enterprise with Protected EAP (PEAP) to perform mutual authentication.</p><p><strong>WPA2-Enterprise with EAP-TLS</strong> is considered one of the most secure EAP methods. With its inclusion in the initial release of the WPA2 standard, it enjoys wide support in wireless access points and in numerous operating systems such as Microsoft Windows, Linux and Apple OS X. EAP-TLS uses a public key infrastructure (PKI) to secure communications between devices and a Remote Access Dial In User Service (RADIUS) server through the use of X.509 certificates. While EAP-TLS provides strong mutual authentication, it requires an agency to have established a PKI. This involves either deploying their own certificate authority and issuing certificates, or purchasing certificates from a commercial certificate authority, for every device that accesses the wireless network. This can introduce additional costs and management overheads but the risk and security management advantages are significant.</p><p>The<strong> EAP-TTLS/MSCHAPv2, or simply EAP-TTLS</strong>, method used with WPA2-Enterprise is generally supported through the use of third party software. It has support in multiple operating systems including Microsoft Windows 7, 8, 10 and Server 2012 but does <strong>not</strong> have native support in earlier versions of Microsoft Windows. EAP-TTLS is different to EAP-TLS in that devices do not authenticate to the server when the initial TLS tunnel is created. Only the server authenticates to devices. Once the TLS tunnel has been created, mutual authentication occurs through the use of another EAP method.</p><p>An advantage of EAP-TTLS over PEAP is that a username is never transmitted in the clear outside of the TLS tunnel. Another advantage of EAP-TTLS is that it provides support for many legacy EAP methods, while PEAP is generally limited to the use of EAP-MSCHAPv2.</p><p><strong>PEAPv0/EAP-MSCHAPv2, or simply PEAP</strong>, is the second most widely supported EAP method after EAP-TLS. It enjoys wide support in wireless access points and in numerous operating systems such as Microsoft Windows, Linux and Apple OS X. PEAP operates in a very similar way to EAP-TTLS by creating a TLS tunnel which is used to protect another EAP method. PEAP differs from EAP-TTLS in that when the EAP-MSCHAPv2 method is used within the TLS tunnel, only the password portion is protected and not the username. This may allow an intruder to capture the username and replay it with a bogus password in order to lockout the user’s account, causing a denial of service for that user. While EAP-MSCHAPv2 within PEAP is the most common implementation, Microsoft Windows supports the use of EAP-TLS within PEAP, known as PEAP-EAP-TLS. This approach is very similar in operation to traditional EAP-TLS yet provides increased protection, as parts of the certificate that are not encrypted with EAP-TLS are encrypted with PEAP-EAP-TLS. The downside to PEAP-EAP-TLS is its support is limited to Microsoft products.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="18.2.9.R.03." ><![CDATA[<p>Ultimately, an agency’s choice in authentication method will often be based on the size of their wireless deployment, their security requirements and any existing authentication infrastructure.  If an agency is primarily motivated by security they can implement either PEAP-EAP-TLS or EAP-TLS.  If they are primarily motivated by flexibility and legacy support they can implement EAP-TTLS.  If they are primarily motivated by simplicity they can implement PEAP with EAP-MSCHAPv2.</p>]]></paragraph>

<block title="Evaluation of 802.1X authentication implementation"><paragraph title="18.2.10.R.01." ><![CDATA[<p>The security of 802.1X authentication is dependent on three main elements and their interaction.  These three elements include supplicants (clients) that support the 802.1X authentication protocol, authenticators (wireless access points) that facilitate communication between supplicants and the authentication server, and the authentication server (RADIUS server) that is used for authentication, authorisation and accounting purposes.  To provide assurance that these elements have been implemented appropriately, supplicants, authenticators and the authentication server used in wireless networks must have completed an appropriate product evaluation.</p>]]></paragraph>

<block title="Issuing certificates for authentication"><paragraph title="18.2.11.R.01." ><![CDATA[<p>Certificates for authenticating to wireless networks can be issued to either or both devices and users.  For assurance, certificates must be generated using a certificate authority product or hardware security module (HSM) that has completed an appropriate product evaluation.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="18.2.11.R.02." ><![CDATA[<p>When issuing certificates to devices accessing wireless networks, agencies need to be aware of the risk that these certificates could be stolen by malicious software.  Once compromised, the certificate could be used on another device to gain unauthorised access to the wireless network.  Agencies also need to be aware that in only issuing a certificate to a device, any actions taken by a user will only be attributable to the device and not a specific user.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="18.2.11.R.03." ><![CDATA[<p>When issuing certificates to users accessing wireless networks, they can either be in the form of a certificate that is stored on a device or a certificate that is stored within a smart card. Issuing certificates on smart cards provides increased security, but usually at a higher cost. Security is improved because a user is more likely to notice a missing smart card and alert their local security team, who is then able to revoke the credentials on the RADIUS server. This can minimise the time an intruder has access to a wireless network.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="18.2.11.R.04." ><![CDATA[<p>In addition, to reduce the likelihood of a stolen smart card from being used to gain unauthorised access to a wireless network, two-factor authentication can be implemented through the use of Personal Identification Numbers (PINs) on smart cards.  This is essential when a smart card grants a user any form of administrative access on a wireless network or attached network resource.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="18.2.11.R.05." ><![CDATA[<p>For the highest level of security, unique certificates should be issued for both devices and users. In addition, the certificates for a device and user must not be stored on the same device. Finally, certificates for users accessing wireless networks should be issued on smart cards with access PINs and not stored with a device when not in use.</p>]]></paragraph>

</block>
<block title="Using commercial certification authorities for certificate generation"><paragraph title="18.2.12.R.01." ><![CDATA[<p>A security risk exists with EAP-TTLS and PEAP when a commercial certificate authority’s certificates are automatically trusted by devices using vendor trusted certificate stores. This trust can be exploited by obtaining certificates from a commercial certificate authority under false pretences, as devices can be tricked into trusting their signed certificate. This will allow the capture of authentication credentials presented by devices, which in the case of EAP-MSCHAPv2 can be cracked using a brute force attack granting not only network access but most likely Active Directory credentials as well.<br>To reduce this risk, devices can be configured to:</p><ul>
<li>validate the server certificate;</li>
<li>disable any trust for certificates generated by commercial certificate authorities that are not trusted;</li>
<li>disable the ability to prompt users to authorise net servers or commercial certificate authorities; and</li>
<li>set devices to enable identity privacy to prevent usernames being sent prior to being authenticated by the RADIUS server.</li>

<block title="Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) authentication"><paragraph title="18.2.14.R.01." ><![CDATA[<p>The RADIUS authentication process that occurs between wireless access points and the RADIUS server is distinct and a separate to the 802.1X authentication process.  During the initial configuration of wireless networks using 802.1X authentication, a shared secret is entered into either the wireless access points or the RADIUS server.  If configured on the wireless access points, the shared secret is sent to the RADIUS server via the RADIUS protocol, and vice versa if configured on the RADIUS server.  This shared secret is used for both RADIUS authentication and confidentiality of RADIUS traffic.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="18.2.14.R.02." ><![CDATA[<p>An intruder that is able to gain access to the RADIUS traffic sent between wireless access points and the RADIUS server may be able to perform a brute force or an off-line dictionary attack to recover the shared secret. &nbsp;This in turn allows the intruder to decrypt all communications between wireless access points and the RADIUS server. &nbsp;To mitigate this security risk, communications between wireless access points and a RADIUS server must be encapsulated with an additional layer of encryption using an appropriate encryption product (See <a href="http://nzism.gcsb.govt.nz/ism-document#Chapter-15745">Chapter 17 – Cryptography</a>).</p>]]></paragraph>

<block title="Connecting wireless networks to fixed networks"><paragraph title="18.2.31.R.01." ><![CDATA[<p>When an agency has a business requirement to connect a wireless network to a fixed network, it is important that they consider the security risks. While fixed networks can be designed with a certain degree of physical security, wireless networks are often easily accessible outside of the agency’s controlled area.  Treating connections between wireless networks and fixed networks in the same way agencies would treat connections between fixed networks and the Internet can help protect against an intrusion originating from a wireless network against a fixed network.  For example, agencies can implement a gateway to inspect and control the flow of information between the two networks.</p>]]></paragraph>

<block title="Radio Frequency (RF) Propagation &amp; Controls"><paragraph title="18.2.33.R.01." ><![CDATA[<p>An additional method to limit a wireless network’s footprint is through the use of radio frequency (RF) shielding on an agency’s premises.  While expensive, this will limit the wireless communications to areas under the control of an agency. RF shielding on an agency’s premises has the added benefit of preventing the jamming of wireless networks from outside of the premises in which wireless networks are operating.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="18.2.33.C.01." classification="All Classifications" compliance="Should" cid="3617"><![CDATA[<p>The effective range of wireless communications outside an agency’s area of control SHOULD be limited by:</p><ul>
<li>Minimising the output power level of wireless devices.</li>

<block title="Interference between wireless networks"><paragraph title="18.2.34.R.01." ><![CDATA[<p>Where multiple wireless networks are deployed in close proximity, there is the potential for RF interference to adversely impact the availability of the network, especially when networks are operating on commonly used default channels of 1 and 11.  This interference is also apparent where a large number of wireless networks are is use in close proximity to the agency’s premises.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="18.2.34.R.02." ><![CDATA[<p>Sufficiently separating wireless networks through the use of channel separation can help reduce this risk.  This can be achieved by using wireless networks that are configured to operate with at least one channel separation.  For example, channels 1, 3 and 5 could be used to separate three wireless networks.</p>]]></paragraph>

<li>have a fully patched software and operating system;</li>
<li>only required services running;</li>
<li>use encrypted non-replayable authentication; and</li>
<li>apply network restrictions that only allow secure Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and secure Real Time Transport (RTP) traffic from IP phones on a VLAN to reach the server.</li>

<li>Design a highly operationally optimised network requiring minimal maintenance;</li>
<li>Provide resources, including SBCs, softswitches and media gateways that are shared between a number of customers (such as multi-tenanted data centres);</li>
<li>The standard model may not accommodate all unique agency or NZ Government requirements which will then require special consideration.</li>

</block>
<block title="Definitions"><paragraph title="19.5.5." ><![CDATA[<p>A Session Border Controller (SBC) is a device (physical or virtual) used in IP networks to control and manage the signalling and media streams of real-time UC and VoIP connections.&nbsp; See also <a href="http://nzism.gcsb.govt.nz/ism-document#Section-16369">Section 18.3 – Video &amp; Telephony Conferencing and Internet Protocol Telephony</a>.&nbsp; It includes establishing, controlling, and terminating calls, interactive media communications or other VoIP connections.&nbsp; SBCs enable VoIP traffic to navigate gateways and firewalls and ensure interoperability between different SIP implementations.&nbsp; Careful selection of SBCs will provide such functionality as prevention of toll fraud, resistance to denial of service attacks and resistance to eavesdropping.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="19.5.6." ><![CDATA[<p>Unified Communications (UC) is a term describing the integration of real-time and near real time communication and interaction services in an organisation or agency.&nbsp; UC may integrate several communication systems including unified messaging, collaboration, and interaction systems; real-time and near real-time communications; and transactional applications.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="19.5.7." ><![CDATA[<p>UC may, for example, include services such as instant messaging (chat), presence information, voice, mobility, audio, web &amp; video conferencing, data sharing (such as interactive whiteboards), voicemail, e-mail, SMS and fax.  UC is not necessarily a single product, but more usually a set of products designed to provide a unified user-interface and user-experience across multiple devices and media-types.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
</subsection>
<subsection title="Purpose"><paragraph title="19.5.8." ><![CDATA[<p>Traditional demarcation points, such as media gateways, are no longer natural boundaries.  Older firewall technology impacts the performance of communications systems, including VoIP and UC.  SBCs were introduced to improve performance and provide interoperability with real-time and near real-time communications.  They provide a new natural demarcation point.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="19.5.9." ><![CDATA[<p>SBCs can provide a demarcation or normalisation point within the agency’s network, allow enforcement of agency specific security policies and provide a greater degree of accountability than the usual contract with service providers.</p>]]></paragraph>
 </subsection>
<subsection title="Risks and Threats"><paragraph title="19.5.10" ><![CDATA[<p>Risks and threats associated with the use of VoIP and UC include:</p><ul>
<li>Confidentiality (eavesdropping);</li>
<li>Integrity (enabling fraud and theft as well as compromising privacy); and</li>
<li>Availability (including Denial of Service [DoS or DDoS]).</li>
</ul>]]></paragraph>
 <block title="Confidentiality"><paragraph title="19.5.11." ><![CDATA[<p>There is a high likelihood of eavesdropping in VoIP systems. Traditional telephone systems require physical access to tap a line or compromise a PABX or switch.  In VoIP networks, virtual LAN environments can be exploited remotely to identify weaknesses within and between virtual LANs and gain access to valuable information.  Sniffing is another form of eavesdropping that involves capturing unencrypted voice traffic with malware or a specific VoIP sniffer tool.  In common with other Internet connected systems, adversary-in-the-middle exploits are also used to eavesdrop on both data and VoIP networks.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Integrity"><paragraph title="19.5.12." ><![CDATA[<p>Exploits such as caller ID spoofing are relatively easy to execute and can be extremely costly to businesses.  Information from a stolen credit card or acquisition of other sensitive data, can compromise an employee’s caller ID, and have funds transferred while posing as the employee.  Cyber criminals can also change an employee’s registration information in order to eavesdrop on or intercept all incoming calls for that individual.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="19.5.13." ><![CDATA[<p>Integrity compromise may include modification or insertion into UC.  As many UC elements, such as voicemail or email, may encompass electronic records as defined in legislation it is vital that these elements are preserved unaltered.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Availability"><paragraph title="19.5.14." ><![CDATA[<p>Because VoIP and UC places high levels of demand on any network, managing Quality of Service (QoS), latency, jitter, packet loss and other service impediments are important aspects of availability.  In the event of major faults or outages, diversity and fault tolerance is vital for all key sites.  To enable failover, for example, where calls leave the customer network, call diversity and call failover are essential configuration elements.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Denial of Service"><paragraph title="19.5.15." ><![CDATA[<p>Denial of Service (DoS) attacks abuse signalling protocols to deny availability of VoIP data and degrade performance.  If the telecommunications network is compromised, it is possible to also traverse systems to attack or infect the agency’s data networks and other systems.</p>]]></paragraph>

<paragraph title="19.5.26.R.02." ><![CDATA[<p>The threat model for IP is well understood.  Data packets can be intercepted or eavesdropped anywhere along the transmission path including the corporate network, by the internet service provider and along the backbone.  The prevalence and ease of packet sniffing and other techniques for capturing packets on an IP based network increases this threat level.  VoIP Encryption is an effective means of mitigating this threat.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="19.5.26.R.03." ><![CDATA[<p>The nature of traffic through an SBC is an important factor in determining the type and configuration of the SBC.  This also plays an important role in determining the resilience of the system.  Systems may require high availability (HA), depending on business requirements for availability and continuity of service.  The use of split trunks for HA normal traffic may provide resilience at reduced costs.</p>]]></paragraph>

<chapter title="22. Enterprise systems security"><section title="22.1. Cloud Computing"><subsection title="Objective"><paragraph title="22.1.1." ><![CDATA[<p>Cloud systems risks are identified and managed and that Official Information and agency information systems are protected in accordance with Cabinet Directives, the <a title="PSR" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://protectivesecurity.govt.nz/" target="_blank">PSR</a>, <a title="Classification System" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://protectivesecurity.govt.nz/classification-system/" target="_blank">the New Zealand Government Security Classification System</a>, the NZISM and with other government security&nbsp;requirements and guidance.</p>]]></paragraph>
 </subsection>
<subsection title="Context"> <block title="Terminology"><paragraph title="22.1.2." ><![CDATA[<p>Terminology and definitions of cloud models and services used in this section are consistent with NIST Special Publication 800-145, The NIST Definition of Cloud Computing, dated September 2011 (see table of References below).</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="22.1.3." ><![CDATA[<p>A fundamental construct in the management of risk in cloud environment is that of Trust Zones and Trust Boundaries. &nbsp;A Trust Zone is a zoning construct based on levels of trust, classification, information asset value and essential information security. &nbsp;A Trust Boundary is the interface between two or more Trust Zones. &nbsp;Trust Zones use the principles of separation and segregation to manage sensitive information assets and ensure security policies are consistently applied to all assets in a particular trust Zone. &nbsp;Refer also to <a href="http://nzism.gcsb.govt.nz/ism-document#Section-17306">Section 22.2 – Virtualisation</a>.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Separation and Segregation"><paragraph title="22.1.4." ><![CDATA[<p>Separation and Segregation is determined by system function and the sensitivity of the data the system stores, processes and transmits.  One common example is placing systems that require a connection to the Internet into a demilitarized zone (DMZ) that is separated and segregated (isolated) from more sensitive systems.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="22.1.5." ><![CDATA[<p>Separation and Segregation limits the ability of an intruder to exploit a vulnerability with the intent of elevating privileges to gain access to more sensitive systems on the internal network.  VLANs may be used to further separate systems by controlling access and providing segregation thus giving additional protection.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Mandates and Requirements"><paragraph title="22.1.6." ><![CDATA[<p>In August 2013, the Government introduced their approach to cloud computing, establishing a ‘cloud first’ policy and an All-of-Government direction to cloud services development and deployment. This is enabled by the Cabinet Minute [CAB Min (13) 37/6B].</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="22.1.7." ><![CDATA[<p>Under the ‘cloud first’ policy state service agencies are expected to adopt approved cloud services either when faced with new procurements, or an upcoming contract extension decision.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="22.1.8." ><![CDATA[<p>In October 2013 the Government approved the GCIO risk and assurance framework for cloud computing, which agencies must follow when they are considering using cloud services [CAB Min (13) 37/6B]. &nbsp;It also directs that no data classified above RESTRICTED should be held in a <em>public</em> cloud, whether it is hosted onshore or offshore.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="22.1.9." ><![CDATA[<p>It is important to note that although agencies can outsource <strong>responsibility</strong> to a service provider for implementing, managing and maintaining security controls, they cannot outsource their <strong>accountability</strong> for ensuring their data is appropriately protected.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Background"><paragraph title="22.1.10." ><![CDATA[<p>The adoption of cloud technologies and services, the hosting of critical data in the cloud and the risk environment requires that agencies exercise caution.  Many cloud users are driven by the need for performance, scalability, resource sharing and cost saving so a comprehensive risk assessment is essential in identifying and managing jurisdictional, sovereignty, governance, technical and security risks.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="22.1.11." ><![CDATA[<p>Typically agencies and other organisations start with a small, private cloud, allowing technical and security architectures, management processes and security controls to be developed and tested and gain some familiarity with cloud technologies and processes.  These organisations then progress by using non-critical data, for example email, and other similar applications, in a hybrid, private or public cloud environment.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="22.1.12." ><![CDATA[<p>There are a number of technical risks associated with cloud computing, in addition to the existing risks inherent in organisational systems.  Attention must also be paid to the strategic, governance and management risks of cloud computing.  Security architecture and security controls also require careful risk assessment and consideration.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="22.1.13." ><![CDATA[<p>Cloud service providers will invariably seek to limit services, liability, compensation or penalties through carefully worded service contracts, which may present particular risks.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="22.1.14." ><![CDATA[<p>Much has been made of the operational cost savings related to cloud technologies, particularly a lower cost of operating.  Less obvious are the risks and related cost of managing risk to an acceptable level.  It is important to note that short term overall cost increases may, in some cases, be attributed to the adoption of cloud technologies and architectures.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="22.1.15." ><![CDATA[<p>Some valuable work in mapping the cloud risk landscape has been undertaken by such organisations as the Cloud Security Alliance, the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), the UK’s Cloud Industry Forum and the European Network and Information Security Agency (ENISA).  It is important to note that the extent of the risk landscape continues to evolve and expand.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Scope"><paragraph title="22.1.16." ><![CDATA[<p>This section provides information and some guidance on the risks associated with cloud computing, its implementation and ongoing use.  Some controls are specified but agencies will necessarily undertake their own comprehensive risk assessment and select controls to manage those risks.</p>]]></paragraph>

<paragraph title="22.2.4." ><![CDATA[<p>A fundamental construct in the management of risk in virtual environments is that of Trust Zones and Trust Boundaries. A Trust Zone is a zoning construct based on levels of trust, classification, information asset value and essential information security. A Trust Boundary is the interface between two or more Trust Zones. Trust Zones use the principles of separation and segregation to manage sensitive information assets and ensure security policies are consistently applied to all assets in a particular trust Zone. As assets are added to a Trust Zone, they inherit the security policies set for that Trust Zone.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="22.2.5." ><![CDATA[<p>Trust Zones will also apply the Principal of Least Privilege, which requires that each element in the network is permitted to access only those other network elements that are required for the node to perform its business function.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="22.2.6." ><![CDATA[<p>Virtualisation is radically changing how agencies and other organisations select, deploy implement and manage ICT. &nbsp;While offering significant benefits in efficiency, resource consolidation and utilisation of CIT assets, virtualisation can add risks to the operation of a system and the security of the data processed and managed by that system.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="22.2.7." ><![CDATA[<p>Virtualisation adds layers of technology and can combine many, traditionally discrete and physically separate components, into a single physical system. &nbsp;This consolidation invariably creates greater impact if faults occur or the system is compromised. &nbsp;Virtual systems are designed to be dynamic and to facilitate the movement and sharing of data. This characteristic is also a prominent attack vector and can make the enforcement and maintenance of security boundaries much more complex.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="22.2.8." ><![CDATA[<p>Virtualisation is susceptible to the same threats and vulnerabilities as traditional ICT assets but traditional security offers limited visibility of virtualised environments where the assets configurations and security postures are constantly changing. Incidents in virtualised environments can rapidly escalate across multiple services, applications and data sets, causing significant damage and making recovery complex.</p>]]></paragraph>
 <block title="Virtualisation risks"><paragraph title="22.2.9." ><![CDATA[<p>Virtualisation risks can be considered in four categories:</p><ul>
<li>Risks directly related to virtualisation technologies;</li>
<li>Systems architecture; implementation and management;</li>
<li>The usage and business models; and</li>
<li>Generic technology risks.</li>
</ul>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Mitigations"><paragraph title="22.2.10." ><![CDATA[<p>The controls described elsewhere in this manual deal with generic technology risks. Important steps in risk mitigation for virtual environments include:</p><ul>
<li>Identify and accurately characterise all deployed virtualisation and security measures beyond built-in hypervisor controls on VMs.</li>
<li>Comparing security controls against known threats and industry standards to determine gaps and select appropriate controls.</li>
<li>Identify and implement anti-malware tools, intrusion prevention and detection, active vulnerability scanning and systems security management and reporting tools.</li>

<block title="Characteristics of public cloud"><paragraph title="23.1.15." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS23C1">There is not a single accepted definition of exactly what constitutes public cloud.  Typically public cloud refers to cloud services that are generally available for anyone to use and are accessed through the internet.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="23.1.16." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS23C1">For the avoidance of doubt, information in this chapter relates to public cloud services where:</p><ul>
<li>The infrastructure used to deliver the public cloud services is not owned by the agency (i.e., server hardware, network devices).</li>
<li>The cloud infrastructure is shared between many customers (‘multi-tenanted’) and is accessible from the internet.</li>
<li>Service provisioning is automated and customer managed.</li>
<li>There is strict isolation between customer instances, and between customer instances and the service provider’s management plane.</li>
<li>Customer data is isolated and controls are in place that strictly manage access by the service provider.</li>
<li>There is a defined shared responsibility matrix for ensuring the services meet customer security requirements.  It should be noted that regardless of the model, agencies will retain ultimate accountability for the security of their information.</li>
<li>There is limited flexibility in how the services are configured, and in at least some aspects there may be no flexibility to customise the service.</li>
</ul>]]></paragraph>

<block title="Responsibility for security in public cloud is necessarily shared"><paragraph title="23.1.17." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS23C1">Agencies share responsibility for the security of their public cloud environments with their cloud service providers.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="23.1.18." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS23C1">Due to differences in how cloud providers operate, there is no single model that can fully describe the boundary between agency security responsibilities and those of the cloud service provider.  Cloud service provider responsibilities may even vary between their different service offerings.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="23.1.19." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS23C1">The following is an example of how responsibilities for security in a cloud service could be shared, although every service is different:&nbsp;</p>

<paragraph title="23.1.20." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS23C1">It is essential that agencies understand where the cloud service provider’s responsibilities end and their own begin for each cloud service they consume, so there is no gap left unaddressed.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="23.1.21." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS23C1">Agency security processes, such as certification and accreditation or incident response, must be revised to ensure compatibility with their cloud service provider’s responsibilities.</p>]]></paragraph>

<block title="Risks and benefits associated with public cloud services"><paragraph title="23.1.22." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS23C1">Public cloud services can provide agencies with significant security benefits when adopted in a controlled and well understood manner, including:</p><ul>
<li>Pervasive identity and authorisation model.</li>
<li>Consistent, software-orchestrated environments running immutable workloads.</li>
<li>Automated response to security incidents or misconfigurations.</li>
<li>Fine-grained access control.</li>
<li>Scalable logging, monitoring and audit.</li>
<li>Improved levels of baseline security.</li>
<li>Enhanced visibility of security state.</li>
</ul>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="23.1.23." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS23C1">The use of public cloud services introduces additional specific risks that require careful control selection to manage.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="23.1.24." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS23C1">The following examples highlight key areas of public cloud-specific risks that need to be understood and managed:</p><ul>
<li>Traditional barriers limiting the movement of agency data across legal jurisdictions can be significantly reduced through the use of cloud services.</li>
<li>Cloud service provider self-service tools can be subject to manipulation impacting agency infrastructure.</li>
<li>Agency systems delivered using cloud services are typically accessible from the internet, including management interfaces, unless controls are put in place.</li>
<li>Agency data is stored on shared platforms, in multiple locations, with agencies ultimately being accountable for ensuring information is secured.</li>
<li>Cloud environments present large, high value targets, where single exploits can impact large numbers of customers.</li>
<li>Cloud services are easier to consume without needing to involve common governance processes, such as change control, increasing the risk of using shadow services without adequate information security controls in place.</li>
<li>On-demand services, coupled with rapid-elasticity, can lead to inappropriate use of agency cloud environments.  Agencies are responsible for tracking billing and usage metrics and ensuring appropriate controls are in place to manage fiscal constraints.</li>
</ul>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="23.1.25." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS23C1">The GCDO Cloud Risk Assessment process is intended to help agencies understand these, and other, risks associated with the use of public cloud.</p><p class="NormS23C1"> </p>]]></paragraph>

<block title="Public cloud impacts on security control selection"><paragraph title="23.1.26." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS23C1">Depending on whether responsibility for implementing security controls rests on the cloud service provider or the agency, enterprise security controls or standards may not be possible to implement uniformly in public cloud services, for example:</p><ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li>Agents used to manage configuration or collect system telemetry may not be able to be deployed across public cloud services.</li>
<li>Log messages may not be able to be centrally collected, or log information tailored to agency requirements, from public cloud services.</li>
<li>Network information, such as packet captures, may not be feasible to collect.</li>
<li>Traditional security devices, such as firewalls and proxy servers, may not be able to be deployed.</li>

<block title="Security boundaries in cloud"><paragraph title="23.1.27." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS23C1">Security boundaries exist to identify where differing security requirements and policies need to be applied to information and infrastructure assets operated in support of agency outcomes.&nbsp; Well defined security boundaries are a key construct in support of:</p><ul>
<li>Protecting environments by providing control enforcement points to manage information flows between internal systems and externally to the environment.</li>
<li>Providing containment points where the impact of incidents can be limited in scope, which also aids in recovery.</li>
</ul>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="23.1.28." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS23C1">Well defined security boundaries can ensure that information is accessible for authorised users and that restrictions do not limit those users’ access to information to which they are entitled.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="23.1.29." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS23C1">There are three key constructs used to describe security policy boundaries in the NZISM.&nbsp; These are <em>classification</em>, <em>security domain</em> and <em>trust zone</em>. &nbsp;Information and systems are subject to the combined requirements described in these policies.&nbsp;</p>

<paragraph title="23.1.30." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS23C1">In public cloud, the <em>classified system</em> refers to the highest level of classified information that can be stored, or processed, by systems in the agency’s cloud environment.  The highest level of classified information the classified system can store or process is based on the lower of:</p><ul>
<li>The highest classification the system is accredited to operate at, AND</li>
<li>The lowest clearance level authorised users of the system hold.</li>
</ul><p class="NormS17C1">The highest classification of information a <em>classified system</em> in public cloud can be accredited to operate with is RESTRICTED.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="23.1.31." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS23C1">Minimum security requirements based on classification are described in the Protective Security Requirements and the NZISM.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="23.1.32." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS23C1">A <em>security domain</em> in public cloud can be categorised as a group of <em>trust zones</em> operating under a common set of security requirements and policies.  These security requirements and policies are formed through a combination of:</p><ul>
<li>Minimum security control requirements from the PSR and NZISM, determined by the classification.</li>
<li>Security control requirements to manage the unique threat environment presented by the use of the public cloud services.</li>
<li>Additional security control requirements to manage specific risks identified through risk assessments.</li>
</ul>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="23.1.33." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS23C1">Examples of the unique threat environment related to the use of public cloud services include:</p><ul>
<li>Access to the underlying infrastructure by the public cloud service provider systems and staff.</li>
<li>Differing relative importance of security controls, such as identity, and the addition of different types of privileged access such as for managing service subscriptions and billing (including terminating services) that can have immediate effect.</li>
<li>Geographic locations where the public cloud services are being delivered from.</li>
<li>Security controls being defined and implemented by the public cloud service provider.</li>
<li>The ease of extending access to third parties, including third party applications, through in-built federation and directory integration services in public cloud.</li>
<li>The ease of shifting data between services and geographic locations in public cloud environments compared to on-premise systems.</li>
<li>The control and visibility of the security state of the underlying infrastructure platforms, including the physical hosting environment.</li>
</ul>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="23.1.34." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS23C1">Defining <em>trust zones</em> provides a mechanism to differentiate security controls used to manage access to information and services within an agency’s public cloud environment.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="23.1.35." ><![CDATA[<p>In the public cloud environment, <em>trust zones</em> represent combinations of public cloud services (made up of user, system and data objects) that are authorised to interact with each other and are protected by a common set of security capabilities. &nbsp;The security controls associated with these security capabilities are applied at policy enforcement points:</p>
<p><img class="leftAlone" title="" src="assets/NZISM/PCS-Section-1-Diagram-3-Security-Boundaries-3.png" alt="" width="600" height="305"></p>]]></paragraph>

<paragraph title="23.1.37." ><![CDATA[<p>In public cloud, access control policy enforcement points are tied to authorised combinations of user, system, and data object identities.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Security boundaries between cloud providers and customers"><paragraph title="23.1.38." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS23C1">A significant difference between public cloud and traditional computing is the additional set of administration services used by the cloud service provider to manage the overall cloud platform.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="23.1.39." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS23C1">Some of these administration services are exposed to tenants to facilitate tenancy management, such as maintaining customer contact and billing details or creating and deleting top level tenant resources.  In some circumstances, third parties can be provided access to perform these actions on behalf of tenants.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="23.1.40." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS23C1">Due to the significant impact from a compromise, access to these services and the associated privileged identities requires a high degree of trust in those responsible.&nbsp; Ensuring separation of duties (i.e., multi-user authorisation, see section <a href="http://nzism.gcsb.govt.nz/ism-document#Paragraph-15709">16.7.19</a>) in this area is highly recommended. <strong><br></strong></p>

<block title="Virtualisation and multi-tenant security in public cloud"><paragraph title="23.1.41." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS23C1">Within a public cloud environment adequately architected, designed, and implemented virtualisation technologies can be used to provide isolation between tenants and separation between security domains.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="23.1.42." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS23C1">Public cloud service providers that are designed to use technology to implement strict isolation between tenant environments, and separate customer management from platform management, are more likely to provide adequately architected security controls to support security domain separation in a virtualised environment.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="23.1.43." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS23C1">Examples of adequately architected security controls that support tenant isolation in public cloud services can include:</p><ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li>Zero touch configuration of infrastructure using well defined infrastructure as code pipelines.</li>
<li>Separation of the cloud provider platform’s administrative control interfaces from customer accessible tenant management services.</li>
<li>An inability for cloud provider staff to access customer data except through customer authorised access channels (i.e., the platform does not provide ‘back door’ access to customer data).</li>
</ol>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="23.1.44." ><![CDATA[<p>At a minimum, a security domain control boundary exists between components where different parties undertake configuration and management responsibilities. <strong><br></strong></p>

<block title="Collaboration between agencies in public cloud"><paragraph title="23.1.45." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS23C1">Public cloud services, due to their multi-tenant design and support for integration to multiple identity providers, can provide a convenient platform for collaboration systems between agencies.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="23.1.46." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS23C1">It is usually not possible, nor desirable, to implement traditional DMZ or Landing Zone network architectures to facilitate third party access to an agency’s public cloud services where collaboration is the goal.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="23.1.47." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS23C1">For public cloud collaboration systems, it is often more practical to grant access to individual third party identities, or to federate (i.e., trust) the third party’s identity service to perform authentication on the collaboration system’s behalf.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="23.1.48." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS23C1">When multiple identity systems are used to control access to shared public cloud collaboration systems, the shared system operates to a <em>common policy</em> that covers all of the participating agencies security requirements.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="23.1.49." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS23C1">The <em>common policy</em> reflects a different security domain from each of the participating agencies, providing the equivalence of a DMZ environment in public cloud. <strong><br></strong></p>

<li>introduces a third party into the process (as in the case of public cloud or hosted private cloud); or</li>
<li>potentially alters internal governance structures (as in the case of self-hosted private cloud).</li>
</ul>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="23.2.5." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS23C2">The primary issue to remember when governing cloud computing is that an organisation can never outsource responsibility for governance, even when using external providers. This is always true, cloud or not, but is useful to keep in mind when navigating cloud computing’s concept of shared responsibility.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="23.2.6." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS23C2">As with any outsourcing arrangement, agencies bear ultimate responsibility for identifying and managing these risks even if they rely on their cloud service provider to implement mitigating controls.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="23.2.7." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS23C2">Cloud services that are hosted or managed from outside New Zealand pose jurisdictional, data sovereignty, and privacy risks. Even when the service is hosted in New Zealand and subject to New Zealand law, an overseas provider may also be subject to its home country’s privacy, data access, and lawful intercept legislation, which may conflict with New Zealand law.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="23.2.8." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS23C2">Cloud services that support multiple agencies or All-of-Government capabilities also pose governance and risk management challenges that must be addressed by establishing privacy, security, and compliance policies in order to protect the corporate assets and intellectual property of participating organisations’ data.</p>]]></paragraph>

<block title="Obligations and responsibilities"><paragraph title="23.2.9." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS23C2">Agencies must be aware of their statutory and regulatory obligations to protect Official, Classified and personal information and data.  Any move to using cloud services cannot allow compromise of these statutory obligations.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Cloud contracts"><paragraph title="23.2.10." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS23C2">Cloud contracts should consider data stewardship, data sovereignty, jurisdiction, storage and access, including any backups.  It remains, however, the responsibility of individual agencies to ensure their legislative and regulatory responsibilities for data stewardship are met.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="23.2.11." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS23C2">As with any outsourcing arrangement, use of cloud services carries the risk of the provider going out of business or otherwise being unable to provide contracted services to the consuming agency. This is a commercial risk that technical security controls cannot address, but one agencies need to consider as part of their due diligence.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="23.2.12." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS23C2">It is essential that appropriate legal advice is taken before any cloud contracts are finalised.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Regular assurance checks"><paragraph title="23.2.13." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS23C2">Changes made to a cloud tenancy may have an adverse impact on the security posture of an agency’s cloud service configuration. Usually, in such circumstances (e.g., if the change was initiated by the agency on-site) this may trigger the commencement of the certification and accreditation process. In addition, changes would usually be subject to approval, review, and testing, as part of an agency’s IT change control process. However, this may not be the case in a cloud environment, as platform changes are made by the cloud service provider and may occur with minimal or no notice (see <a href="http://nzism.gcsb.govt.nz/ism-document#Section-12847">section 5.8 – Independent assurance reports</a>).</p>]]></paragraph>

<paragraph title="23.5.5." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS23C5">Public cloud introduces particular aspects of logging that agencies must consider, including:</p><ul>
<li>Responsibility for logging and detecting anomalies is shared between the agency and its cloud service provider.</li>
<li>Cloud services may introduce differences in what information is able to be logged, where it can be logged, and in what format the log messages are constructed.  It may not be possible for the consuming agency to customise logging parameters.</li>
<li>Key security components used by cloud services may be sourced from multiple providers (e.g., identity federation or SaaS integration). Effective log monitoring and incident investigation requires these logs to be accessible and be able to be correlated with each other.</li>
<li>Some components of the environment where logs are traditionally collected may not be available in cloud environments (e.g., network traffic or boundary devices), or the information may need to be collected in different ways.</li>
<li>Only a subset of log information may be able to be exported from a cloud environment due to technical or cost implications.</li>
</ul>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph title="23.5.6." ><![CDATA[<p class="NormS23C5">Agencies running across multiple clouds or running a hybrid of public cloud and on premise infrastructure must also balance the advantages of platform-specific capabilities against the need for centralised visibility.

<p>Accountable Material</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Accountable information, an accountable item or accountable material refers to the accountability controls applied to specified information, equipment or materials. Accountable information, items or materials are usually uniquely identifiable (usually a serial or identification number) and are tracked from acquisition or creation to final disposal. Safe custody is a fundamental and is achieved through:</p>
<ul>
<li>is easily to compute;</li>
<li>will usually output a significantly different value, even for small changes made to the input; and</li>
<li>can detect many types of data corruptions.</li>
<li>allocation to a specific individual (issued or responsibility designated);</li>
<li>allocation or designation of responsibility may also require a specific briefing related to the handling, care and protection of particular types of classified information and COMSEC equipment;</li>
<li>the allocation, issue or designation being recorded;</li>
<li>strict controls over access and movement (special handling requirements);</li>
<li>maintenance of a register (manual or electronic); and</li>
<li>regular audits to ensure accountability conditions continue to be adhered to and any briefings are current.</li>
</ul>
<p>As a general rule, accountable information, items or materials are afforded physical security protection by specifying special handling and accountability conditions. Examples may include cryptographic or COMSEC equipment, other high value equipment, money, computers or information subject to privacy legislation and regulation. Cryptographic or COMSEC equipment and any information classified as CONFIDENTIAL, SECRET or TOP SECRET is accountable by definition.</p>

<p>Accountability</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Most contemporary definitions include two key elements:</p>
<ul>
<li>the conferring of responsibility and authority; and</li>
<li>the answering for the use of that authority.</li>
</ul>
<p>Accountability exists when the performance of tasks or functions by an individual or organisation, are subject to another’s oversight, direction or request that they provide information or justification for their actions.</p>
<p>Answering for the use of authority means reporting, explaining actions, assuming obligations, and submitting to outside or external judgement. &nbsp;Having responsibility means having the authority to act, the power to control and the freedom to decide.&nbsp; It also means that one must behave rationally, reliably and consistently in exercising judgement.</p>

</ul>
<p>Checksums are often used to verify the integrity of operating system, programme, library or other programmatic elements, images and firmware updates.&nbsp; Checksums typically range in length from one to 64-bits, depending on the intended usage and algorithm used to determine the checksum.</p>
<p>Checksums are related to hash functions, fingerprints, randomisation functions, and cryptographic hash functions.&nbsp; Note, however, each of those concepts are distinct, have different applications and therefore different design goals.&nbsp; Check digits and parity bits are special uses of checksums.&nbsp; It is important to recognise that, although related, a hash is not a checksum.</p>
