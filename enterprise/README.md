## Testing locally ðŸš€

New: use the config builder on the `config` folder.

To run CISO Assistant Enterprise locally in a straightforward way, you can use Docker compose.

1. Launch docker-compose script with enterprise docker-compose.yml file:

```sh
./docker-compose-build.sh -f enterprise/docker-compose-build.yml
```

When asked for, enter your email and password for your superuser.

You can then reach CISO Assistant using your web browser at [https://localhost:8443/](https://localhost:8443/)

## Setting up CISO Assistant Enterprise for development

> [!NOTE]
> This section assumes that you have already set up the community frontend and backend, and use poetry for managing the backend dependencies.

### Running the backend

1. Go to enterprise backend directory.

```sh
cd enterprise/backend
```

2. Install the shell plugin (which [replaces the shell command](https://python-poetry.org/docs/cli/#shell)).

```sh
poetry self add poetry-plugin-shell
```

3. Open poetry shell.

```sh
poetry shell
```

4. Install community backend module.

```sh
cd ../../backend
poetry install
```

5. Install enterprise backend module.

```sh
cd ../enterprise/backend
poetry install
```

6. Set the `SQLITE_FILE` environment variable if you use SQLite.

```sh
export SQLITE_FILE=db/ciso-assistant-enterprise.sqlite3
```

7. Apply migrations.

```sh
poetry run ./manage.sh migrate
```

8. Create a Django superuser, that will be CISO Assistant administrator.

```sh
poetry run ./manage.sh createsuperuser
```

9. Run the development server.

```sh
poetry run ./manage.sh runserver
```

To close the poetry shell you [**should**](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry-plugin-shell?tab=readme-ov-file#usage) use `exit`.

### Running the frontend

1. cd into the enteprise frontend directory.

```bash
cd enterprise/frontend
```

3. Start a development server (make sure that the django app is running).

```bash
make dev
```

4. Reach the frontend on <http://localhost:5173>
