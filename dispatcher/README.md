# CISO Assistant Dispatcher

The **CISO Assistant Dispatcher** is a command-line tool that bridges event-driven messaging with the CISO Assistant API to orchestrate actions based on incoming Kafka messages.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.8+**
- A running Kafka cluster (can be any Kafka-compatible cluster, e.g. [Redpanda](https://redpanda.com/))
- Access to the CISO Assistant REST API
- Required Python packages (see [Installation](#installation) below)

## Running the dispatcher as a CLI tool

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/intuitem/ciso-assistant-community.git
   cd ciso-assistant-community/dispatcher
   ```

2. **Install dependencies using `uv`:**

   This project uses `uv` for dependency management. If you haven't installed uv yet, follow the instructions on its [documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).
   To install the project dependencies, run:

   ```bash
   uv sync
   ```

   This command will install all required packages as specified in the `pyproject.toml`.

3. **Run the interactive configuration script:**

   ```bash
   uv run dispatcher.py init-config -i
   ```

4. Consume messages from the `observation` topic

   ```bash
   uv run dispatcher.py consume
   ```

## Running the dispatcher as a dockerized service

> [!NOTE]
> It is recommended you use environment variables to configure the dispatcher if you are running it as a Docker container.
> Please check the [Environment variables reference](#environment-variables-reference) section for the full specification.

### Running the dispatcher on its own

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/intuitem/ciso-assistant-community.git
   cd ciso-assistant-community/dispatcher
   ```

2. **Build the Docker image:**

   ```bash
   docker build -t ciso-assistant-dispatcher .
   ```

3. **Run the dispatcher container**

   ```bash
   docker run -d \
   --name ciso-assistant-dispatcher \
   -e API_URL=https://localhost:8443 \
   -e BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS=localhost:9092 \
   -e USER_EMAIL=user@company.org \
   -e USER_PASSWORD=your_password \
   ciso-assistant-dispatcher
   ```

## Configuration

You can configure the dispatcher using environment variables, the `init-config` command, or the `.dispatcher_config` configuration file.

> [!NOTE]
> Configuration from environment variables takes precedence over the configuration file. If both are set for a given setting, the environment variable will be used.

### Environment variables reference

```bash
DEBUG=True/False # Set to true to enable debug logging

API_URL=https://localhost:8443 # The URL of the CISO Assistant REST API
USER_EMAIL=user@company.org # The email address of the CISO Assistant user to authenticate with
USER_PASSWORD=your_password # The password of the CISO Assistant user to authenticate with
AUTO_RENEW_SESSION=True/False # Set to True to enable automatic token refresh, do not set if using token-based authentication
USER_TOKEN=your_ciso_assistant_access_token # Personal Access Token, do not set if using credentials-based authentication
VERIFY_CERTIFICATE=True/False # Set to True to verify SSL certificates between the dispatcher and API
BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS=localhost:9092 # The Kafka bootstrap servers, comma separated list
KAFKA_USE_AUTH=False # Set to True to enable authentication to Kafka
KAFKA_SASL_MECHANISM=PLAIN # The SASL mechanism to use for authentication (only PLAIN is supported for now)
KAFKA_USERNAME=your_username # The username for Kafka authentication
KAFKA_PASSWORD=your_password # The password for Kafka authentication
ERRORS_TOPIC=errors # The Kafka topic to send errors to
S3_URL=localhost:9000 # The URL of the S3 storage
S3_ACCESS_KEY=your_access_key # The access key for S3 storage
S3_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key # The secret key for S3 storage
```

### Initializing the config file

Run the `init-config` command to create or reset the configuration file:

```bash
python dispatcher.py init-config
```

You can add the `-i` flag for an interactive mode, which will prompt you for the necessary information.

This command creates a file with the following structure:

```yaml
rest:
  url: "https://localhost:8443"
  verify_certificate: True
credentials:
  email: "user@company.org"
  password: ""
```

Update this file with your actual REST API credentials.

### Authentication to the CISO Assistant API

Use the `auth` command to authenticate with the CISO Assistant API.
There are currently two modes of authentication supported by the dispatcher:

- Token-based authentication
- Credentials-based authentication

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Whichever mode you choose, it is tied to a CISO Assistant user and will inherit their permissions.

#### Token-based authentication (soon to be released)

This is done using a Personal Access Token (PAT) that you can generate in CISO Assistant.
To use token-based authentication, you need to set the `USER_TOKEN` environment variable or specify it in the configuration file or during interactive configuration definition using the `init-config` with the `-i` flag enabled.

#### Credentials-based authentication

This is done using your email and password. You can specify these credentials in the configuration file or pass them as command-line arguments to the `auth` command.

```bash
python dispatcher.py auth --email your_email@company.org --password your_password
```

If you have specified the credentials in the configuration file, or in the `USER_EMAIL` and `USER_PASSWORD` environment variables, you can skip the `--email` and `--password` arguments.

> [!WARNING]
> Multi-factor authentication is not yet supported in the dispatcher. Accounts with MFA enabled will not be able to authenticate using the dispatcher.

#### Automatic token refresh

Using credentials-based authentication, it is possible to enable silent re-authentication on token expiration. You can do so using the `auto_renew_session` setting. As usual, it can be set either as an environment variable or in the configuration file.

The authentication token will be saved in a temporary file (`.tmp.yaml`).

### S3 storage configuration

The URL of the S3 storage can be set in the configuration file or via the `S3_URL` environment variable. The dispatcher will use this URL to upload files when processing messages.

#### Authenticate requests to the S3 storage

Requests to the S3 storage are authenticated using the `S3_ACCESS_KEY` and `S3_SECRET_KEY` settings as environment variables or in the configuration file.

## Usage

The dispatcher is invoked via its CLI. Below are the available commands:

### Consuming messages

Start the dispatcher to consume messages from the Kafka `observation` topic. The consumer will process each message, dispatch it to the corresponding handler, and send errors to the error topic if needed.

```bash
python dispatcher.py consume
```

### Messages reference

Below are the messages that can be consumed by the dispatcher. These must be sent as JSON to the `observation` Kafka topic.

#### update_applied_control

Updates one or many applied controls.

Fields:

- `selector`: Identifies the target applied control to update.
- `values`: The updated values of the target applied controls. Please read the API specification for the full list of supported fields.

```json
{
  "message_type": "update_applied_control",
  "selector": {
    "ref_id": "foo"
  },
  "values": {
    "priority": "1"
  }
}
```

#### update_requirement_assessment

Updates one or many requirement assessments.

Fields:

- `selector`: Identifies the target requirement assessment to update.
- `values`: The updated values of the target requirement assessments. Please read the API specification for the full list of supported fields.

```json
{
  "message_type": "update_requirement_assessment",
  "selector": {
    "compliance_assessment__ref_id": "ISO_001",
    "requirement__ref_id": "A.5.1"
  },
  "values": {

  }
}
```

#### upload_attachment

Uploads an attachment either from base64 encoded data or fetched from a S3 bucket.

Fields:

- `selector`: Identifies the target evidence to upload the attachment to. If not specified, a new evidence will be created with `file_name` as its name.
- `values`
  - `applied_controls`: The applied control to which the evidence is attached. If not specified, the evidence will be created/modified without it being attached to an additional control. If the target evidence already has controls, the applied controls will be added to the existing ones.
  - `file_content`: The base64 encoded content of the file to upload. This field is required if `file_s3_bucket` is not specified.
  - `file_name`: The name of the file to upload. This field is required.
  - `file_s3_bucket`: The S3 bucket where the file is stored. This field is required if `file_content` is not specified.

##### Using base64 encoded data

```json
{
  "message_type": "upload_attachment",
  "selector": {
    "name": "Sample evidence",
    "ref_id": "bar"
  },
  "values": {
    "applied_controls": {
      "ref_id": "foo"
    },
    "file_content": "base64_encoded_data",
    "file_name": "sample.jpeg"
  }
}
```

##### Using S3

```json
{
  "message_type": "upload_attachment",
  "selector": {
    "name": "Sample evidence",
    "ref_id": "bar"
  },
  "values": {
    "applied_controls": {
      "ref_id": "foo"
    },
    "file_s3_bucket": "bucket",
    "file_name": "sample.jpeg"
  }
}
```

### Selectors

A selector is an object used to identify the target resource in CISO Assistant. It contains key/value pairs that are used to filter the resource. These can be any filters that are supported by the CISO Assistant API (e.g. `ref_id`, `name`, `eta`...).

You can find the full list of supported filters in the API specification, accessible on `<CISO_ASSISTANT_API_URL>/schema/swagger/`

Selector schema:

```json
{
  "selector": {
    "target": "single | multiple"
    "key1": "value1",
    "key2": "value2"
  }
}
```

#### Selector target

Set to `single` if not specified. This can be either `single` or `multiple`. This is used to identify a message's target resources.

## Deployment

The dispatcher can be used as a CLI tool or deployed as a service. To deploy it as a service, you can use Docker or any other containerization tool.

Out of the box, we provide a Dockerfile and the `make_config.py` script to generate a docker compose file containing CISO Assistant and the dispatcher.

The `make_config.py` script is accessible under `config/make_config.py`. Please refer to the readme file in the `config` directory for more information on how to use it.
